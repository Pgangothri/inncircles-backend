Introduction\\n\\nThe construction industry is one of the\\nworld’s major industries. Its achievement in\\nrebuilding areas devastated by both natural and\\nman-made disasters, and in providing power,\\nservices and communications to meet the\\nrising needs and expectations of people\\nthroughout the world, has conferred great\\nbenefits on the human _ race. Despite\\nmechanization, construction remains a major\\nemployer of labour — it often employs between\\n9 and 12 per cent of a country’s working\\npopulation, and sometimes as much as 20 per\\ncent.\\n\\nThere has, however, been a price to pay\\nfor this continuous growth and _ activity.\\nAlthough it is difficult to obtain accurate\\nStatistics in an industry in which many\\naccidents go undetected and unreported, in\\nmany countries known fatal accidents, and\\nthose involving loss of working time,\\nfrequently exceed those in any _ other\\nmanufacturing industry.\\n\\nContributing to the high rate of accidents\\nare those characteristics of the industry which\\ndistinguish it from the rest of the\\nmanufacturing sector. These are:\\n\\ne the high proportion of small firms and of\\nself-employed workers;\\n\\ne the variety and comparatively short life of\\nconstruction sites;\\n\\ne the high turnover of workers;\\n\\ne the large numbers of seasonal and migrant\\nworkers, many of whom are unfamiliar with\\nconstruction processes;\\n\\ne exposure to the weather;\\n\\ne the many different trades and occupations.\\n\\nThe purpose of the manual\\n\\nAll of us who have looked for and found a\\njob in construction are concerned that our\\nwork should be safe and that conditions on the\\nconstruction site should not cause damage to\\nour life, our health and our professional skills.\\n\\nThrough this manual — Safety, health and\\nwelfare on construction sites — we will help\\nyou to consider safety, health and welfare\\nconditions on construction sites in your\\ncountry and to learn about possible solutions\\nto the problems you encounter.\\n\\n[Page 7]\\n\\n\\n[Page 8]\\n2. Safety organization and management\\n\\nUnlike the remainder of this manual,\\nwhich is intended primarily for workers and\\ntheir supervisors, this chapter is intended to\\nremind management at a more senior level of\\nthe foundations they need to lay to achieve a\\nsafe and healthy site. It will also, however,\\ninform workers and supervisors of the\\nessentials of a proper safety management\\nsystem.\\n\\nThe improvement of safety, health and\\nworking conditions depends ultimately upon\\npeople working together, whether\\ngovernments, employers or workers. Safety\\nmanagement involves the functions of\\nplanning, identifying problem areas,\\ncoordinating, controlling and directing the\\nsafety activities at the work site, all aimed at\\nthe prevention of accidents and ill health\\n\\n(figure 1). Accident prevention is often\\nmisunderstood, for most people believe\\nwrongly that the word “accident” is\\n\\nsynonymous with “injury”. This assumes that\\nno accident is of importance unless it results in\\nan injury. Construction managers are\\nobviously concerned with injuries to the\\nworkers, but their prime concern should be\\nwith the dangerous conditions that produced\\nthe injury — with the “incident” rather than the\\n“injury”. On a construction site there are many\\nmore “incidents” than injuries. A dangerous\\nact can be performed hundreds of times before\\nit results in an injury, and it is to eliminate\\nthese potential dangers that managers’ efforts\\nmust be directed. They cannot afford to wait\\nfor human or material damage before doing\\nanything. So safety management means\\napplying safety measures before accidents\\nhappen. Effective safety management has three\\nmain objectives:\\n\\n— to make the environment safe;\\n— to make the job safe,\\n— to make workers safety conscious.\\n\\n2.1 Safety policies\\n\\nSafe and healthy working conditions do\\nnot happen by chance. Employers need to have\\na written safety policy for their enterprise\\nsetting out the safety and health standards\\nwhich it is their objective to achieve. The\\npolicy should name the senior executive who\\nis responsible for seeing that the standards are\\nachieved, and who has authority to allocate\\nresponsibilities to management and\\nsupervisors at all levels and to see they are\\ncarried out.\\n\\nThe safety policy should deal with the\\nfollowing matters:\\n\\n— arrangements for training at all levels.\\nParticular attention needs to be given to\\nkey workers such as scaffolders and crane\\noperators whose mistakes can be\\nespecially dangerous to other workers;\\n\\n— safe methods or systems of work for\\nhazardous operations: the workers\\ncarrying out these operations should be\\ninvolved in their preparation;\\n\\n— the duties and responsibilities of\\nsupervisors and key workers;\\n\\n— arrangements by which information on\\nsafety and health is to be made known;\\n\\n— arrangements for setting up safety\\ncommittees;\\n\\n— the selection and control of\\nsubcontractors.\\n\\n2.2 Safety organization\\n\\nThe organization of safety on the\\nconstruction site will be determined by the size\\nof the work site, the system of employment\\nand the way in which the project is being\\norganized. Safety and health records should be\\nkept which facilitate the identification and\\nresolution of safety and health problems on the\\nsite.\\n\\n[Page 9]\\nRouel ero iolea:\\n\\nMANAGEMENT\\nOF SAFETY AND\\n\\nHEALTH\\n\\nFigure 1. Safety organization and management must cover all aspects of the employer’s or the contractor’s operations\\n\\nSO}IS UOTIN.AYSUOD UO dILIJOM puL YQeaY ‘AJaJVS\\n\\n[Page 10]\\nSafety organization and management\\n\\nIn construction _— projects ~~ where\\nsubcontractors are used, the contract should set\\nout the responsibilities, duties and _ safety\\nmeasures that are expected of the\\nsubcontractor’s workforce. These measures\\nmay include the provision and use of specific\\nsafety equipment, methods of carrying out\\nspecific tasks safely, and the inspection and\\nappropriate use of tools. The person in charge\\nof the site should also assure that materials,\\nequipment and tools brought on to the site\\nmeet minimum safety standards.\\n\\nTraining should be conducted at all\\nlevels, including managers, supervisors and\\nworkers. Subcontractors and their workers\\nmay also need to be trained in site safety\\nprocedures, because teams of _ specialist\\nworkers may mutually affect each others’\\nsafety.\\n\\nThere should also be a system so that\\nsite management has information quickly\\n\\nabout unsafe practices and _ defective\\nequipment.\\nSafety and health duties should be\\n\\nspecifically assigned to certain persons. Some\\nexamples of duties which should be listed are:\\n\\n— provision, construction and maintenance\\nof safety facilities such as access\\nroadways, pedestrian routes, barricades\\nand overhead protection;\\n\\n— construction and installation of safety\\nsigns;\\n— safety provisions peculiar to each trade;\\n\\n— testing of lifting machinery such as cranes\\nand goods hoists, and lifting gear such as\\nropes and shackles;\\n\\n— inspection and rectification of access\\nfacilities such as scaffolds and ladders;\\n\\n— inspection and cleaning of welfare\\nfacilities such as toilets, clothing\\naccommodation and canteens;\\n\\n— transmission of the relevant parts of the\\nsafety plan to each work group;\\n\\n— emergency and evacuation plans.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\nNo safety policy or plan is workable\\nwithout assigning a specific duty:\\n\\n— toa specific person;\\n\\n— to be completed at a specific point\\nof time.\\n\\nThe safety policy and plan must be\\ntransmitted down the line to the\\nworkers — it is their safety that the\\nplan is intended to safeguard.\\n\\n2.2.1 Safety officer/manager\\n\\nEvery construction company of any\\nsize should appoint a properly qualified\\nperson (or persons) whose special and main\\nresponsibility is the promotion of safety and\\nhealth. Whoever is appointed should have\\ndirect access to an executive director of the\\ncompany. His or her duties should include:\\n\\n— the organization of information to be\\npassed from management to workers,\\nincluding those of subcontractors;\\n\\n— the organization and conduct of safety\\ntraining programmes, including\\ninduction training for all workers on the\\nsite;\\n\\n— the investigation and review of the\\ncircumstances and causes of accidents\\nand occupational diseases so as to advise\\non preventive measures;\\n\\n— acting as consultant and technical\\nadviser to the safety committee;\\n\\n— participation in pre-site planning.\\n\\nTo carry out these functions the safety\\nofficer should have experience of the\\nindustry and should be properly trained and\\nqualified and, where such exists, should be a\\nmember of a recognized professional safety\\nand health body.\\n\\n[Page 11]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n2.2.2 Supervisors\\n\\nGood planning and organization at each\\nwork site and the assignment of clear\\nresponsibility to supervisors are fundamental\\nto safety in construction. “Supervisor” here\\nmeans the first level of supervision, which on\\n\\nsite is variously termed as “foreman”,\\n“chargehand”, “ganger’’, and so on.\\nEach supervisor requires the direct\\n\\nsupport of site management and should seek to\\nassure within his or her field of competence\\nthat:\\n\\n— working conditions and equipment are safe;\\n— workplace safety is regularly inspected;\\n\\n— workers have been adequately trained for\\nthe job they are expected to do;\\n\\n— workplace safety measures are\\nimplemented;\\n\\n— the best solutions are adopted using\\navailable resources and skills;\\n\\n— necessary personal protective equipment is\\navailable and used.\\n\\nMaking the work site safe will require\\nregular inspection and provision of the means\\nfor taking remedial measures. The training of\\nworkers enables them to recognize the risks\\ninvolved and how they can overcome them.\\nWorkers should be shown the safe way of\\ngetting a job done.\\n\\n2.2.3 Workers\\n\\nEvery worker is under a moral, and often also\\na legal, duty to take the maximum care for his\\nor her own safety and that of fellow workers.\\nThere are various ways of involving workers\\ndirectly in site conditions, such as:\\n\\ne “‘tool-box briefing” (figure 2), a five- to\\nten-minute session with the supervisor just\\nprior to starting a task gives the workers\\nand the supervisor a chance to talk about\\nsafety problems likely to be encountered\\nand potential solutions to those problems.\\nThis activity is simple to implement and it\\nmay prevent a serious accident;\\n\\ne “safety check”; a check by workers that\\nthe environment is safe before starting\\nan operation may allow them to take\\nremedial action to correct an unsafe\\nsituation that could later endanger them\\nor another worker.\\n\\n2.3 Safety committees\\n\\nAn active safety committee is a great\\nspur to safety. Its primary purpose is to\\nenable management and workers to work\\ntogether to monitor the site safety plan so as\\nto prevent accidents and improve working\\nconditions on site. Its size and membership\\nwill depend on the size and nature of the site\\nand upon differing legal and_ social\\nconditions in the countries concerned, but it\\nshould always be an action-oriented group of\\npeople in which both management and\\nworkers are represented. The safety\\ncommittee carrying out a site inspection\\ntogether raises the level of safety\\nconsciousness at the site. The duties carried\\nout by an active safety committee will\\ninclude:\\n\\n— regular and frequent meetings to discuss\\nthe safety and health programme on site\\nand to make recommendations to\\nmanagement;\\n\\n— consideration of reports of safety\\npersonnel;\\n\\n— discussion of accident and illness reports\\nin order to make recommendations for\\nprevention;\\n\\n— evaluating improvements made;\\n\\n— examination of suggestions made by\\nworkers, particularly by safety\\nrepresentatives;\\n\\n— planning and taking part in educational\\n\\nand training programmes, and information\\nsessions.\\n\\n[Page 12]\\nSafety organization and management\\n\\nFigure 2. ‘Tool-box briefing” should be carried out regularly\\n\\n2.4 Safety representatives\\n\\nThese are appointed by _ workers,\\nsometimes in accordance with national\\nlegislation, to represent them in dealing with\\nsafety and health matters on site. They should\\nbe experienced workers well able to recognize\\nconstruction site hazards, although they are\\nlikely to require training to acquire new skills\\nin inspection and in using information. Their\\nfunctions are:\\n\\n— to make representations to the management\\nabout matters of concern regarding the\\nsafety and health of workers;\\n\\n— to attend meetings of the safety committee;\\n\\n— tocarry out regular and systematic\\ninspections on site;\\n\\n— to investigate accidents in conjunction with\\nmanagement to determine their causes and\\nto propose remedies;\\n\\n— to investigate complaints by workmates;\\n\\n— to represent workers in discussions with\\ngovernment inspectors at their site visits.\\n\\ns ior\\n\\nK\\n=\\n=\\n\\nog OVA\\n\\n1\\n\\n‘TALS\\n\\n*\\nWY PTET TT IUMENE PAU Ee WI\\n\\nbo\\nus\\n\\na\\niS\\n\\nSafety representatives should be given\\nsufficient time off to be trained and to carry\\nout their duties properly. These activities\\nshould be without loss of pay, for a safe and\\nhealthy site benefits both employers and\\nworkers.\\n\\n2.5 Outside agencies\\n2.5.1 Government intervention\\n\\nIn many countries there are laws and\\nregulations governing conditions of work in\\nthe construction industry. These are usually\\nenforced by factory or labour inspectors who\\nare often also able and willing to provide\\nadvice on compliance. However, even in the\\nbest-regulated countries the numbers of\\ninspectors are too few to provide day-to-day\\nsurveillance on site, even were it their job to\\ndo so.\\n\\n[Page 13]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n2.5.2 International agreements\\n\\nNational laws and regulations are often\\nbased upon _ international conventions,\\nagreements, declarations and programmes.\\nThese have been drawn up by different United\\nNations organizations including the\\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) and\\nthe World Health Organization (WHO).\\n\\nIn 1988 the ILO adopted the Safety and\\nHealth in Construction Convention (No.167),\\nand its accompanying Recommendation\\n(No.175), which provide a foundation of law\\non which safe and healthy working\\nconditions can be built. The texts of this\\nessential Convention and Recommendation\\nare reproduced in Annex 2 of this manual.\\n\\n[Page 14]\\n3. Site planning and layout\\n\\n3.1 Site layout\\n\\nA badly planned and untidy site is the\\nunderlying cause of many accidents resulting\\nfrom falls of material and collisions between\\nworkers and plant or equipment (figures 3 and\\n4). Space constraints, particularly in urban\\nwork sites, are nearly always the biggest\\nlimiting factor and a layout which caters best\\nfor the safety and health of workers may\\nappear to be difficult to reconcile with\\nproductivity. Proper planning by management\\nis an essential part of preparation and\\nbudgeting for the safe and efficient running of\\na construction operation.\\n\\nBefore work even begins on site, thought\\nneeds to be given to:\\n\\n— the sequence or order in which work will be\\ndone and to any especially hazardous\\noperations or processes;\\n\\n— access for workers on and around the site.\\nRoutes should be free from obstruction and\\nfrom exposure to hazards such as falling\\nmaterials, materials-handling equipment\\nand vehicles. Suitable warning notices\\nshould be posted. Routes to and from\\nwelfare facilities need equal consideration.\\nEdge protection will be required at the edge\\nof floor openings and stairs, and wherever\\nthere is a drop of 2 m or more (figure 5);\\n\\nFigures 3 and 4. Bad site layout and lack of space prevent safe movement of workers and vehicles and cause\\n\\naccidents\\n\\nBad layout\\n\\nGood layout\\n\\n[Page 15]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nFigure 5. Edge protection: Guard-rails and toe\\nboards at open edges of floors and working\\nplatforms to prevent workers from falling\\n\\n— routes for vehicular traffic. These should be\\n“one way’ as far as practicable. Traffic\\ncongestion prejudices the safety of workers,\\nespecially when impatient drivers unload\\ngoods hurriedly;\\n\\n— storage areas for materials and equipment.\\nMaterials need to be stored as close as\\npossible to the appropriate workstation, e.g.\\nsand and gravel close to the cement-\\nbatching plant, and timber close to the\\njoinery shop. If this is not practicable, it is\\nimportant to schedule the arrival of\\nmaterials;\\n\\n— the location of construction machinery. This\\nis usually dependent on operational\\nrequirements so that tower cranes are\\nsubject to constraints such as their radius of\\noperation, and pick-up and unloading\\n\\npoints. The objective should be to avoid the\\nneed to slew the load over workers;\\n\\n— the location of trade workshops — these are\\nnot usually moved after they are built;\\n\\n— the location of medical and welfare\\nfacilities. On large sites sanitary facilities\\nfor both sexes should be provided at several\\nlocations;\\n\\n— artificial lighting at places where work\\ncontinues or workers pass after dark;\\n\\n— site security. The site should be fenced in to\\nkeep out unauthorized persons, children in\\nparticular, and to protect the public from\\nsite hazards. The type of fencing will\\ndepend on the location of the site, but in\\npopulated areas it should be at least 2 m\\nhigh and without gaps or holes. Overhead\\nprotection will be necessary if tower crane\\nloads pass over public thoroughfares;\\n\\n— arrangements to keep the site tidy and for\\nthe collection and removal of waste;\\n\\n— the need for low-voltage electric power\\nsupplies for temporary lighting, portable\\ntools and equipment;\\n\\n— training needs of both workers and\\nsupervisors.\\n\\nPoint to remember\\n\\ne The time spent on planning will make\\nfor a safer site and save money.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\ne In what ways could you improve on the\\nlayout of your site?\\n\\ne What are some options for sites with\\nproblems of limited space?\\n\\n3.2 Site tidiness\\n\\nAs a worker you can make a major\\ncontribution to safe working conditions on site\\nby attention to tidiness. There are many\\naccidents due to tripping, slipping or falling\\nover materials and equipment which have been\\n\\n[Page 16]\\nSite planning and layout\\n\\nleft lying around, and stepping on nails which Figure 7.

Excavations\\n\\n4.1 General measures\\n\\n4.1.1 Hazards\\n\\nMost construction work involves some\\nform of excavation for foundations, sewers\\nand underground services. Excavation or\\ntrenching work can be highly dangerous and\\neven some of the most experienced workers\\nhave been caught by the sudden and\\nunexpected collapse of the unsupported sides\\nof a trench. Buried under a cubic metre of soil\\nyou will be unable to breathe due to pressure\\non the chest, and quite apart from any\\nphysical injury you will quickly suffocate and\\ndie, for even this comparatively small amount\\nof soil weighs over | tonne.\\n\\nExcavation work involves the removal\\nof soil or a mixture of soil and rock. Water is\\nnearly always present, even if only as\\nmoisture in the soil, and heavy rain is a\\nfrequent cause of soil slip. The possibility of\\nflooding presents an additional hazard which\\nshould always be considered. Cracks are\\ncaused by pressure release as soil is removed,\\nor from drying out in hot weather.\\n\\nSoil varies in its nature (e.g. fine sand\\nwhich flows easily, and stiff clay which is\\nmore cohesive). However, no soil can be\\nrelied upon to support its own weight and\\nprecautions always need to be taken to\\nprevent the collapse of the sides of an\\nexcavation of more than 1.2 m in depth.\\n\\n4.1.2 Causes of accidents\\n\\nThe main causes of accidents resulting\\nfrom excavation work are as follows:\\n\\ne workers trapped and buried in an\\nexcavation owing to the collapse of the\\nsides;\\n\\ne workers struck and injured by material\\nfalling into the excavation;\\n\\ne workers falling into the excavation;\\n\\n13\\n\\ne unsafe means of access and insufficient\\nmeans of escape in case of flooding;\\n\\ne vehicles driven into or too close to the edge\\nof an excavation, particularly while\\nreversing, causing the sides to collapse;\\n\\ne asphyxiation or poisoning caused by fumes\\nheavier than air entering the excavation,\\ne.g. exhaust fumes from diesel and petrol\\nengines.\\n\\n4.1.3 Safety precautions to prevent the\\ncollapse of excavations, and falls\\n\\nThe sides of the excavation or trench\\nshould be sloped or battered back to a safe\\nangle of repose, usually 45°, or be supported\\nby timbering or other suitable means to\\nprevent a collapse. The type of support\\nnecessary will depend upon the type of\\nexcavation, the nature of the ground and the\\ngroundwater conditions.\\n\\nPlanning is vital. Make sure that there\\nare enough materials to support the length of\\nthe trench to be cut, for the trench support\\n\\nmust be installed without delay as_ the\\nexcavation progresses. At least random\\ntimbering or piling is required in all\\n\\nexcavations, but excavations 1.2 m or more in\\ndepth should be provided with adequate\\ntimbering or sheeting (figure 8). Close\\nboarding or sheeting is required if the ground\\nis unstable or lacks cohesion. Never work\\nahead of the trench support.\\n\\nShoring should be erected, altered or\\ndismantled only by a competent worker\\noperating under supervision. Wherever\\npracticable, it should be installed before\\nexcavating to the final depth of the trench — it\\nis necessary to begin when the trench is less\\nthan 1.2 m deep. The excavation and\\ninstallation of shoring should then proceed by\\nstages until the full depth is reached. You\\nshould be fully aware of the procedures to\\n\\n[Page 19]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nfollow to rescue a fellow worker trapped by a\\nfall of earth.\\n\\nFigure 8. Shoring to prevent the collapse of the\\nsides of an excavation consisting of timber\\nor steel frames with close boarding\\nbetween frames\\n\\nWorkers often fall into excavations.\\nErect suitable barriers high enough (i.e. about\\n1 m) to prevent falls (figure 9). Projecting\\ntrench supports can often be used for this\\n\\npurpose.\\n\\n4.1.4 Inspection\\n\\nExcavations should be inspected by a\\ncompetent person before work begins and at\\nleast once a day where work is in progress.\\nThey should be thoroughly examined by a\\ncompetent person once a week and a record\\nkept of such inspections.\\n\\n4.1.5 Adjoining buildings\\n\\nWherever possible, an excavation\\nshould not be so close and deep as to\\nundermine any adjacent building or structure.\\nPrecautions should be taken by shoring, and\\nso on, to prevent any collapse or fall when the\\nstability of a building or structure may be\\n\\n14\\n\\naffected by excavation work in progress\\n(figure 10).\\n\\nFigure 9. Barriers along the sides of an excavation\\nto prevent workers falling into it\\n\\nsad LL NN Tah K \'\\n\\nFigure 10. Excavation near a building: Shoring\\nrequired to prevent collapse of the\\nbuilding\\n\\n4.1.6 Edges\\n\\nYou should not store, or move,\\nmaterials and equipment near the edge of an\\n\\n[Page 20]\\nExcavations\\n\\nexcavation. Danger may be caused either by\\nmaterials falling on those working below, or\\nby increased loading on the surrounding\\nground so as to cause the timbering or\\nsupports to the sides of the excavation to\\ncollapse. Spoil and waste heaps should\\nsimilarly be kept well away from the edges of\\nexcavations.\\n\\n4.1.7. Vehicles\\n\\nAdequate and_ well-anchored — stop\\nblocks should be provided on the surface to\\nprevent vehicles being driven into the\\nexcavation while tipping, a particular hazard\\nwhen reversing (figure 11). The blocks should\\nbe placed at a sufficient distance away from\\nthe edge of the excavation to avoid the danger\\n\\nof it breaking away under the weight of the\\nvehicles.\\n\\n4.1.8 Access\\n\\nMake sure that there are safe means of\\naccess and egress, such as a properly secured\\nladder, if you are working in an excavation.\\nThis is of particular importance when there is\\na risk of flooding and rapid escape is\\nessential.\\n\\n4.1.9 Lighting\\n\\nThere should be adequate lighting\\naround the area of an excavation, particularly\\nat access points and openings in barriers.\\n\\nFigure 11.

The\\nshallowness of an excavation or the\\nsolid appearance of the ground are not\\n\\nnecessarily an indication of safety.\\n\\nDeep trenches look dangerous, but\\nmost fatal accidents occur in trenches\\nless than 2.5 m deep.\\n\\nAlways wear a safety helmet when you\\nwork in an excavation.\\n\\n4.2 Buried or underground services\\n\\nBefore you do any digging, either by\\nhand or with an excavator, remember that\\nthere may be underground services below the\\nsurface. In built-up areas, always assume that\\nelectrical cables, water services and sewers\\nare present. In some locations there may also\\nbe gas pipes. Some of these services look\\nalike, so when you find buried services you\\nshould always assume the worst. Striking\\nelectric cables may cause death or severe\\ninjuries by electric shock or severe burns.\\nBroken gas pipes will leak and may cause a\\nfire or explosion. Water and sewer pipes if\\nbroken may create sudden risks by flooding\\nan excavation or by causing its sides to\\ncollapse.\\n\\n4.2.1 Electrical cables\\n\\nEvery year workers digging on\\nconstruction sites suffer severe burns when\\nthey accidentally hit live buried electrical\\ncables. Always treat buried cables as live.\\nBefore you begin excavating, inquire of the\\nelectricity authority, the local authority or the\\nsite owner if they have any plans of the layout\\nof cables in the area. Even if plans exist,\\nremember that some cables may not be\\nmarked on the plan or may not be exactly\\n\\n16\\n\\nwhere the plan shows, for cables rarely follow\\nan exact straight line.\\n\\nLook around for traffic signs, street\\nlights and substations which are usually\\nsupplied by buried cables. Use a cable locator\\nif you have one — remember that if cables are\\nclose together the locator may not be able to\\ntell them apart. Some types of cable cannot be\\ntraced by locators. Once you have found the\\ncable, notify your supervisor and fellow\\nworkers. The position of the cable should be\\nmarked with chalk, crayon or paint or, if the\\nground is too soft for this, with wooden pegs\\n(figure 12). Never use sharp spikes. Once the\\napproximate position of a buried cable is\\nknown, use hand tools to expose it. Use\\nspades and shovels rather than forks or pick-\\naxes. Keep a careful watch for evidence of\\ncables during digging work. Power tools\\nshould not be used within half a metre of a\\ncable.\\n\\n4.2.2 Other services\\n\\nAs with electricity supplies, inquire of\\nthe appropriate authorities and the site owner\\nif plans are available of the layout of gas\\npipes, water pipes, sewers and_ telephone\\ncables, and then use similar working methods.\\n\\nDo not use mechanical excavators\\nwithin half a metre of a gas pipe. If you smell\\ngas, make sure there are no sources of ignition\\nnearby such as a lit cigarette or running\\nvehicle engine. Keep away from the area,\\nkeep other people away and summon the gas\\nauthority. Do not use heavy plant or\\nequipment over or near a gas pipe, as the pipe\\nmay fracture.\\n\\nAll exposed pipes and cables should be\\nsupported when an excavation is open. Do not\\nuse them to support equipment or as steps to\\nget in and out of the excavation. Make sure\\nwhen backfilling a trench with a gas pipe that\\nthe fill is adequately compacted beneath the\\npipe to prevent settlement which could lead to\\npipe fracture.\\n\\n[Page 22]\\nExcavations\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\ne Hand dig with care, as cables may be\\njust below the surface.\\n\\nUse a spade or shovel and not a fork or\\npick-axe, and do not spear the tools into\\nthe ground.\\n\\nIf you find a cable embedded in\\n\\nconcrete, do not break it out but seek\\nadvice.\\n\\nIf a cable is damaged, even slightly,\\nkeep well clear.\\n\\nDo not work bare chested.

Scaffolding\\n\\n5.1 Hazards\\n\\nFalls of persons from a height, and\\nsimilarly of materials and objects, represent\\nthe most serious safety risk in the construction\\nindustry. A high proportion of deaths are\\ncaused by falls. Many of the falls are from\\nunsafe working places or from unsafe means\\nof access to working places. This chapter of\\nthe manual, and those which follow dealing\\nwith ladders and hazardous processes, are\\naimed at tackling the problem.\\n\\nScaffolding can be defined as a\\ntemporary structure supporting one or more\\nplatforms and which is used either as a\\nworkplace or for the storage of materials in the\\ncourse of any type of construction work,\\nincluding both maintenance and demolition\\nwork. This is the sense in which it is used here.\\n\\nWhere work cannot safely be done from\\nthe ground or from the building or structure\\nbeing worked upon, then there should always\\nbe suitable and sufficient scaffolding. This\\nmust be properly constructed of sound material\\nwhich is of adequate strength to provide you\\nwith both means of safe access and a safe\\nplace of work.\\n\\nScaffolds should be erected, altered or\\ndismantled only by competent persons under\\nsupervision, and this training manual sets out\\ngeneral principles for the various common\\ntypes of scaffold. After erection, scaffolds\\nshould be inspected at least once a week and a\\nwritten report on each inspection kept.\\n\\nThere are many different materials used\\nto construct scaffolding, such as_ steel,\\naluminium, wood and bamboo. Whatever the\\nmaterial, the principles of safe scaffolding\\nremain the same that it should be of adequate\\nstrength to support the weight and stress which\\nthe processes and workers will place upon it,\\nthat it is securely anchored and stable, and that\\nit is designed to prevent the fall of workers and\\n\\n19\\n\\nmaterials. The design and erection of tubular\\nmetal scaffolding, which is increasingly found\\nworldwide, is taken as the example in this\\nmanual.\\n\\n5.2 Independent tied scaffolds\\n\\nAn independent scaffold consists of a\\nplatform resting on horizontal tubes, usually\\ncalled transoms, which are fixed at 90° to the\\nface of the building and which are secured at\\nboth ends to a row of uprights, or standards,\\nand to horizontal tubes, often called ledgers,\\nrunning parallel to the face of the building. An\\nindependent scaffold, although it must be tied\\nto the building or structure, does not rely on it\\nfor its strength (figure 13).\\n\\nThe uprights of the scaffolding should\\nbe placed on firm and level ground and the\\nbase plates at their feet should rest on timber\\nsole boards. These help to ensure that the load\\ncarried by each upright is distributed over a\\nfairly large area and so prevents the upright\\nfrom sinking into the ground and affecting the\\nbalance of the scaffold. Never use material\\nwhich can shatter or move, such as bricks and\\nbroken paving stones, as support for uprights.\\n\\nUprights should be kept equidistant and\\nshould be connected and strengthened by\\nledgers fixed on the inside of the uprights; for\\nstrength, joints in ledgers should be staggered.\\nTransoms should be set on top of ledgers and\\nat right angles to them and the building or\\nstructure. Horizontal distances between\\ntransoms at working platform level will\\ndepend on the thickness of the boards you are\\nusing, and which rest on them. For 38 mm\\nthick boards, transoms should be spaced so\\nthat no scaffold board overlaps by more than\\n150 mm (6 in.) or less than 50 mm. Ledgers\\nand transoms should not project more than is\\nnecessary beyond the general outline of the\\nscaffold, or they become a danger to\\npedestrians or passing vehicles. Bracing is\\n\\n[Page 25]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nessential to stiffen the scaffold and prevent\\nsideways movement, and it should run\\ndiagonally from ledger to ledger or upright to\\nupright. Braces may run parallel to each other\\n\\nor rise in zig-zag fashion. If bracing has to be\\nremoved for the passage of workers and\\nmaterial, this should be only within one lift\\nand it should be immediately replaced.\\n\\nFigure 13. An independent tied scaffold which does not rely on the building for its\\nstrength. It has inner and outer rows of uprights or standards\\n\\n5.2.1 Ties\\n\\nMake sure that the scaffold is tied or\\nanchored to the building or structure at\\nsuitable intervals so as to prevent movement.\\nRemember that the effect of wind is greater on\\na sheeted scaffold, and can cause a scaffold\\nwhich is not adequately tied to move away\\nfrom the face of the building and collapse.\\nTies may need to be removed in the progress\\nof the work (e.g. for the installation of\\nglazing), but this should be done one at a time\\nwith the first tie replaced before the next is\\nremoved: it may then be necessary to use a\\ndifferent form of tie. As a rough guide, the\\narea of scaffold per tie should not, generally,\\nbe more than 32 sq. m reduced to 25 sq. m for\\na sheeted scaffold.\\n\\n20\\n\\n5.2.2. Working platforms and gangways\\n\\nThe scaffold boards which make up a\\nworking platform should rest squarely and\\nevenly on transoms to prevent the risk of\\ntripping. Where the ends of boards meet,\\ntransoms must be doubled and so spaced that\\nno board overhangs by more than four times\\nits thickness. Too much overhang will cause\\nthe board to tip if you step on it, while too\\nlittle — less than 50 mm — will mean that it is\\neasily dislodged. Normally, each board should\\nhave three supports to prevent it bending or\\nsagging. The space between the edge of the\\nworking platform and the face of the building\\nshould be as small as possible. The width of a\\nworking platform should be sufficient for the\\nwork which is to be carried out from it, and\\nrecommended widths are:\\n\\n[Page 26]\\nScaffolding\\n\\nnot less than 60 cm if used as footing only;\\n\\nnot less than 80 cm if used also for the\\nstacking of material;\\n\\nnot less than 1.1 m if used for the support of\\na trestle platform.\\n\\nGangways or runs should be of adequate\\nwidth for their purpose and should preferably\\nbe horizontal. If the slope exceeds 20°, or the\\nsurface is likely to become slippery with rain,\\nlaths should be fixed at 90° across the slope,\\nallowing a small central gap to accommodate\\nwheelbarrow wheels. Finally, precautions must\\nbe taken to prevent boards lifting in high\\nwinds.\\n\\nFigure 14.\\n\\n5.2.3 Guard-rails and toe boards\\n\\nThe provision of secure guard-rails and\\ntoe boards at every point at which you may\\nfall more than 2 m is critical if falling\\naccidents are to be prevented. Both should be\\nfitted on the inside of the uprights. Guard-rails\\nshould be between 90 cm and 115 m above\\nthe platform to prevent you from easily falling\\nover or under the rail. Toe boards, which are\\nalso intended to prevent material being\\nknocked over the edge of the platform, must\\nrise at least 15 cm above the working platform\\nto achieve this, and if materials are stored to\\ngreater than this height then additional boards\\nmay be necessary or the space filled in with\\nwire mesh (figure 14). If guard-rails and toe\\nboards are removed for the passage of\\nmaterials, replace them as soon as possible.\\n\\nWorking platform showing guard-rail and toe board with wire mesh\\n\\nfilling between them and the closely boarded platform\\n\\n5.3 Single pole or putlog scaffolds\\n\\nA common type of scaffold for smaller\\njobs is a single pole or putlog scaffold which\\nconsists of a platform resting on horizontal\\nputlogs (called transoms in independent\\n\\n21\\n\\nscaffolds) fixed at 90° to the face of the\\nbuilding (figure 15). The outer ends of the\\nputlogs are supported on horizontal ledgers\\nfixed parallel to the face of the building and\\n\\n[Page 27]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nsecured to a single row of uprights or\\nstandards, also parallel to the wall. The\\nflattened inner end of the putlogs rests flat on\\nthe wall, or in holes in the wall, rather than on\\nledgers. It follows that the scaffold cannot\\nstand without the support of the structure.\\nPutlog scaffolds are mostly used where brick\\nstructures are being built. The same principles\\nof good construction as for independent\\nscaffolds are generally applicable.\\n\\nA good base for the single row of\\nuprights is essential and the base plates for\\neach upright should again rest on a timber sole\\nboard — a sole board should be long enough to\\nsupport at least two uprights. The uprights\\nshould be not more than 2 m apart and set at\\n1.3 m from the wall to allow for a five-board\\nplatform. Ledgers should be connected on the\\ninside of the uprights, at a vertical distance of\\nnot more than 2 m — a lesser distance may be\\nnecessary for some types of work — and left in\\nposition as the scaffold rises.\\n\\nFigure 15.\\n\\nPutlogs should rest on and be secured to\\nthe ledgers at horizontal gaps depending on\\nthe thickness of the boards used — of not more\\nthan 1.5 m for boards of 38 mm — while their\\nflattened, or spade, ends should lie on the\\nbrickwork, or enter the wall to a depth of at\\nleast 75 mm. For repointing old brickwork,\\nthe spade ends can rest vertically in joints in\\nthe brickwork. Tying into the building is of\\neven greater importance than with\\nindependent scaffolds, as putlogs can easily\\nwork loose in brickwork. In this type of\\nscaffold, bracing along the face and to the full\\nheight of the scaffold is required. Bracing\\nshould be at an angle of about 45° to the\\n\\nhorizontal and at 30-metre intervals. The\\nrequirements already described for the\\nconstruction of working platforms and\\n\\ngangways and for the erection of guard-rails\\nand toe boards apply equally to putlog\\nscaffolds.\\n\\nA single pole or putlog scaffold, with a single outer row of uprights or\\n\\nstandards and which is partly supported by the building\\n\\n22\\n\\n[Page 28]\\nScaffolding\\n\\nA. scaffold should not be left partly\\nconstructed or dismantled unless adequate\\nnotices warning against its use are displayed\\nand all points of access are blocked off.\\n\\nWith both types of scaffold, there is\\noften a need to provide sheeting, boarding,\\nnetting, fans or brickguards to _ prevent\\nmaterials falling from the scaffold into the\\nstreet or public places (figure 16). Scaffolding\\nis often easily accessible from the street and\\npositive steps such as the removal of access\\nladders should be taken to prevent children\\nclimbing a scaffold, particularly after the close\\nof the working day.\\n\\nFigure 16. Protection of scaffold from falling\\nmaterials — scaffold fan and debris\\nnetting\\n\\n23\\n\\nPoints to remember\\n\\ne Where you cannot work safely from the\\nground or from part of the building, it is\\nbetter to use a suitable scaffold than a\\n\\nladder.\\n\\nUse a scaffold only for the purpose for\\nwhich it has been provided and make\\nsure it is securely anchored or tied to\\nthe building.\\n\\nDo not overload the scaffold. In\\nparticular, do not load it with plant and\\nmaterials unless it has been erected for\\n\\nthis purpose. Never keep materials on\\nthe scaffold unless they are needed for\\nwork within a reasonable time.\\n\\nMake sure that timber used in\\nscaffolding is not painted or treated so\\nthat defects cannot be seen.\\n\\nDo not use bamboo that show signs of\\nrotting or being infested by insects; also\\nexamine the ropes for early signs of\\ndecay, avoid using material about\\nwhich there is doubt.\\n\\n5.4 Tower scaffolds\\n\\nA tower scaffold consists of a platform\\nresting on horizontal ledgers connected to four\\nuprights, supported on base plates if static or\\non castor wheels if mobile (figure 17). It is\\ndevised for painters and others who do\\nlightweight work of limited duration mainly in\\none place.\\n\\n5.4.1 Causes of accidents\\n\\nAccidents can happen when a tower\\ntopples over. This is likely to happen in any of\\nthe following cases:\\n\\n— the ratio of the height of the tower to the\\nwidth of the base is excessive;\\n\\n— the top working platform is overloaded\\ncausing the tower to become unstable;\\n\\n[Page 29]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nFigure 17. Mobile tower scaffold-wheels should be\\nlocked when in use; ladder access should\\nbe inside the tower\\n\\na ladder is placed on the top platform to\\nextend the height of the tower;\\n\\nwork involving percussion tools produces\\nan outward horizontal or lateral force at the\\ntop of the tower;\\n\\na mobile tower is moved with persons or\\nmaterials carried on the top platform;\\n\\nthe tower is used on sloping or uneven\\nground;\\n\\n24\\n\\nthe tower is not tied to the building or\\nstructure where this is necessary;\\n\\naccess to the platform is via the outside of\\nthe tower.\\n\\n5.4.2 Height limitations\\n\\nThe first precaution with tower scaffolds\\nis to achieve stability. For this the ratio of\\nheight to base width should not be more than\\n4:1 for a static tower which you are using\\nindoors. For a static tower used outdoors the\\nratio is reduced to 3.5:1, while for a mobile\\ntower used outdoors it should not be more\\nthan 3:1. Any loading on the platform will\\nraise the centre of gravity of the tower and too\\ngreat a load will endanger its stability.\\n\\nStatic towers should not exceed 12 m in\\nheight when free-standing, and above this\\nheight they should be tied. Mobile towers\\nshould not exceed 9.6 m in height when free-\\nstanding or 12 m when tied to a structure.\\n\\n5.4.3 Structure\\n\\nTowers should be vertical, have a single\\nplatform and be used only on a firm and level\\nbase, with the uprights of static towers on\\nadequate base plates. Dimensions will vary\\naccording to need but corner standards should\\nnever be less than 1.2 m apart. The uprights of\\nmobile towers should have castor wheels of\\nnot less than 125 mm in diameter which are\\nlocked into the base of the uprights. The\\ncastor wheels should be fitted with locks or\\nbrakes which cannot be accidentally released,\\nand you should ensure that the brakes are\\napplied whenever the tower is stationary.\\n\\n5.4.4 The working platform\\n\\nThe platform should be equipped with a\\ncover for the ladder access opening which is\\nable to be fixed in both open and closed\\npositions with a latch. This prevents an\\naccidental step into the opening. The cover\\nshould be provided with a suitable handhold\\nto provide support when you are climbing\\nthrough the opening. Guard-rails and toe\\n\\n[Page 30]\\nScaffolding\\n\\nboards will be necessary for the sides of the\\nworking platform, erected as for independent\\nscaffolds. The ladder provided for access to\\nthe working platform should be positioned\\ninside the tower as a precaution against\\noverturning (figure 17).\\n\\n5.4.5 Movement\\n\\nNever move a mobile tower with persons\\nor materials on the working platform. Move\\nthe tower by pushing and pulling at the base\\nand not by towing with a vehicle.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\nTie the tower into the adjacent structure\\nwherever possible.\\n\\nUse the locks on the wheels whenever\\nthe scaffold is in use.\\n\\nNever climb a mobile scaffold unless\\nthe wheels are locked and on level\\nground.\\n\\nKeep the material on the platform to a\\nminimum.\\n\\nKeep towers away from overhead\\nelectrical supply lines and check that\\nmobile towers are free of overhead\\nobstructions before moving them.\\n\\nAvoid using a tower in windy or severe\\nweather conditions.\\n\\n5.5 Trestle scaffolds\\n\\nTrestle scaffolds are simply working\\nplatforms supported on “A” frames or a\\nsimilar type of folding support.\\n\\nRemember that trestle scaffolds, whether\\nthe trestles be fixed or folding in type, should\\nbe used only for light work of comparatively\\nshort duration (figure 18). Folding trestles\\nshould be used only for scaffolds of one tier in\\nheight, and the working platform should be at\\nleast 430 mm (two scaffold boards) wide. One-\\nthird of the height of the trestles should be\\nabove the working platform. Fixed trestles\\n\\n25\\n\\nshould not be used for scaffolds of more than\\ntwo tiers in height, and where the working\\nplatform is more than 2 m high guard-rails\\nand toe boards should be provided. Trestle\\nscaffolds are not suitable for work situations\\nwhere a person is liable to fall a distance of\\nmore than 4.5 m from the platform.\\n\\nAs with the other types of scaffold,\\ntrestle scaffolds should be set up on a firm and\\nlevel base and firmly fixed so as to prevent\\ndisplacement. Make sure the trestles are\\nadequately braced to ensure rigidity and to\\nresist lateral movement. Trestles should be no\\nmore than 1.35 m apart when boards 38 mm\\nthick are used, and 2.45 m apart if 50 mm\\nboards are used. Wider spans are possible if\\nproprietary staging is used and such staging is\\ngenerally preferable to scaffold boards.\\n\\nInspect the trestles before use and reject\\nthem if they have defective components such\\nas loose or damaged crossbearers, broken or\\ndamaged hinges including missing screws or\\nbolts, or damaged or split stiles.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\ne Never use odd lengths of board to make\\nup the working platform.\\n\\ne Always sit to work if you can do so.\\n\\n[Page 31]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nFigure 18. A trestle scaffold suitable only for light work such as cleaning or painting\\n\\n5.6 Suspended scaffolds\\n\\nSuspended scaffolds are used most\\nfrequently for work on tall buildings or\\nstructures above busy streets, or in other\\nsituations where it is not feasible or economic\\nto build a scaffold from the ground. Suspended\\nscaffolds are of two main types:\\n\\n— suspended platforms, hinged or\\nindependent;\\n— cradles.\\n\\nAll are suspended from the building or\\nstructure by means such as outriggers, tracks\\nand parapet hooks.\\n\\nTypical accidents on all of\\n\\nsuspended scaffold occur because of:\\n\\ntypes\\n\\ndifficulty getting in and out of the\\nsuspended cradle;\\n\\ninsufficient or poorly secured\\ncounterweights;\\n\\n26\\n\\n— failure of suspension ropes;\\n\\n— poor maintenance.\\n\\n5.6.1 Access to the scaffold\\n\\nNormal access should be at either\\nground or roof level. If at roof level the guard-\\nrail of the platform (or cradle) should be at\\nroof or parapet level and only one person at a\\ntime should enter or leave the platform.\\n\\n5.6.2 Suspension ropes\\n\\nTo safeguard against the consequences\\nof a rope failure, a fall arrest device operating\\non a secondary safety rope should be used. All\\nropes should be thoroughly examined by a\\ncompetent person at least once every six\\nmonths.\\n\\n[Page 32]\\nScaffolding\\n\\n5.6.3 The platform\\n\\nThe working platform or cradle should\\nbe inspected before each use and at least once\\na week. The safe working load should be\\nclearly marked on it.\\n\\n5.6.4 Erection and training\\n\\nWhatever type of suspended scaffold is\\nused, the services of a competent person able\\nto supervise construction and subsequent use is\\nrequired. Erection should be carried out only\\nby an experienced person. The only people\\nwho should work from a suspended scaffold\\nare those who have been trained in the use of\\nthe equipment and of its safety devices, and\\nwho are aware in practical terms of its safe\\nworking load and of emergency procedures.\\nRemember that if you work on a suspended\\nscaffold you should always wear an approved\\nsafety harness with a lifeline securely attached\\nto the building.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\ne Do not work on a suspended scaffold\\n\\nunless you have been trained to do so.\\n\\nNever climb up or down the suspension\\nropes to get into or out of the scaffold\\nor cradle.\\n\\n27\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nWhat do you understand by the term\\n“scaffold”?\\n\\nWhen should a scaffold be provided\\ninstead of a ladder?\\n\\nWhat considerations should be given to\\nproviding safe means of access for workers\\nand materials?\\n\\nWhat is the difference between a single\\npole (or putlog) scaffold and an\\nindependent scaffold?\\n\\nWhat are the main causes of accidents\\narising from the use of such scaffolds and\\nwhat precautions can be taken?\\n\\nHow do you ensure that the integrity of a\\nscaffold is maintained throughout its use?\\n\\nWhat precautions are necessary to ensure\\nthe stability of tower scaffolds?\\n\\nFrom your own experience, what\\nunsuitable and unsafe scaffolding have you\\nseen being used, what were the potential\\ndangers and what steps should have been\\ntaken to remove the hazards?\\n\\n[Page 33]\\n\\n\\n[Page 34]\\n6. Ladders\\n\\nEvery year many workers are killed or\\nseverely injured while using ladders of all\\ntypes. Because a ladder is so readily available\\nand inexpensive, its limitations are easily\\noverlooked. So the first question to ask is —\\ncan the job be done more safely using other\\nequipment? For example, a proper working\\nplatform can often ensure that the job is\\nperformed more quickly and efficiently.\\n\\n6.1 Limitations\\n\\nIf you are thinking of using a ladder,\\nremember that if properly used it:\\n\\nenables only one person to climb or\\ndescend at any one time;\\n\\nenables only one person to work from it at\\nany one time;\\n\\nif not lashed at the top, requires two\\nworkers for use — one on the ladder and the\\nother at the bottom;\\n\\nleaves only one hand free; carrying tools\\nor loads up a ladder is difficult and\\ndangerous and the weight which can be\\ncarried is severely limited. There is also\\nthe risk of dropping items on passers-by;\\n\\nrestricts movement;\\nhas to be safely situated and secured;\\n\\nhas a limitation on heights at which it can\\nbe used.\\n\\n6.2 Secure your ladder\\n\\nMore than half of ladder accidents are\\ncaused by the ladder slipping at the base or at\\nthe top. So make sure that you stand the foot\\nof your ladder on a firm and level base. Never\\nwedge one side of the ladder up if the ground\\nis uneven. If possible, level the ground or\\nbury the foot of the ladder. If the ground is\\nsoft, put down a board. Never support the\\nladder by carrying its total weight on the\\nbottom rung — only the stiles or side members\\nare meant for this.\\n\\n29\\n\\nThe head of the ladder should rest\\nagainst a solid surface able to withstand the\\nloads imposed on it; otherwise use a ladder\\nstay. Whenever practicable, tie or lash your\\nladder at the top — someone should hold the\\nladder at the foot while you do so (figure 19).\\nIf this is impracticable, secure the ladder at the\\nbottom by tying it to stakes in the ground or\\nby using sandbags (figure 20). If neither is\\npracticable, a fellow worker should be at the\\nfoot of the ladder to prevent it slipping while\\nyou are working from it, but this precaution is\\nonly effective if the ladder is not more than 5\\nm in length. Your fellow worker should face\\nthe ladder with a hand on each stile and with\\none foot resting on the bottom rung. The use\\nof non-slip pads on ladder feet helps to\\nprevent ladders slipping at the base.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\ne Make sure your ladder is lashed or\\nfooted before you climb it\\n\\nFigure 19. Ladder secured at its upper end,\\nextending above the landing place\\n\\n[Page 35]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nFigure 20. Ladder secured at its foot to stop\\n\\nmovement\\n\\n6.3 Safe use of ladders\\n\\nSafe use means observing the following\\n\\nprecautions:\\n\\nmake sure there are no overhead power\\nlines with which the ladder might make\\ncontact;\\n\\nwooden ladders with wire-reinforced stiles\\nshould be used with the wired side facing\\naway from you. Wire tie rods should be\\nbeneath and not above the rungs;\\n\\nthe ladder should extend at least 1 m above\\nthe landing place, or above the highest\\nrung on which you have to stand, unless\\nthere is a suitable handhold to provide you\\nwith equivalent support (figure 19). This is\\nto stop the risk of over-balancing when\\nyou step off and on at the top;\\n\\nyou should be able to step off the ladder at\\nthe working place without being required\\nto climb over or under guard-rails or over\\ntoe boards.

Safe use of ladders — allow sufficient overlap of extension-ladder sections; carry tools safely; don’t\\noverreach\\n\\n6.4 Care of ladders\\n\\nProper care of ladders involves the\\n\\nfollowing measures:\\n\\nladders need to be inspected regularly by a\\ncompetent person and damaged ladders\\nremoved from service. Timber ladders\\nshould be checked for splits or cracks,\\nsplintering or warping, metal ladders for\\nmechanical damage. Look for missing,\\nloose or worn rungs;\\n\\nladders should be capable of being\\nindividually identified, e.g. by some form\\nof marking;\\n\\nladders not in use should not be left on the\\nground so that they are exposed to weather\\nwater and impact damage. They should be\\nproperly stored on racks under cover and\\nabove ground, and ladders over 6 m in\\nlength should have at least three support\\npoints to avoid sagging;\\n\\na ladder should not be hung from its rungs\\nor from one stile as this tends to pull out the\\nrungs;\\n\\n— timber ladders should be kept in areas with\\n\\ngood ventilation which are free from\\nexcessive heat or dampness;\\n\\ntimber ladders and equipment may be\\ncoated with transparent varnish or\\npreservative, but should not be painted as\\npaint conceals defects;\\n\\naluminium ladders should be given an\\nadequate protective coating when they are\\nlikely to be subject to acids, alkalis or other\\ncorrosive substances.\\n\\n[Page 37]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\ne Always inspect your ladder before you\\nuse it.\\n\\nRemove damaged ladders from use\\nand make sure that they are properly\\nrepaired. If they cannot be properly\\nrepaired, they must be destroyed.\\n\\n6.5 Stepladders\\n\\nStepladders should be spread to their\\nfullest extent and used on a level surface. They\\nshould be placed at right angles to the work\\nwhenever possible. Work should not be carried\\nout from the top platform or tread of a\\nstepladder unless there is an extension to\\nprovide an adequate handhold.\\n\\nThe strings, chains or cords used to\\nprevent stepladders from spreading should be\\nof sufficient and equal length and kept in good\\norder. If you use a stepladder in a doorway,\\nmake sure the door is wedged open.\\n\\n32\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages\\nof using ladders?\\n\\nFor what sort of work are they best suited?\\n\\nWhat are the most common causes of\\nladder accidents?\\n\\nWhat procedures should you follow to take\\ncare of ladders?\\n\\nWhat precautions should you take in using\\nstepladders?\\n\\n[Page 38]\\n7. Hazardous processes\\n\\n7.1 Roof work\\n\\nWithout proper precautions, roof work\\nis among the most hazardous of construction\\noperations. The most common accidents to\\nworkers are due to:\\n\\n— falls from the edge of roofs;\\n— falls through openings in roofs;\\n— falls through fragile roof materials.\\n\\nAlthough most accidents happen to\\nspecialist roofworkers, there are many\\nworkers engaged simply in maintaining and\\ncleaning roofs. To undertake roof work safely\\nyou require knowledge and experience, and\\nspecial equipment. Before the job begins, a\\nsafe system of work must be planned.\\nPrecautions must be adopted to reduce the\\nrisk of a worker falling or, if it occurs, to\\nprevent the fall being the cause of serious\\ninjury. The precautions to be taken will\\ndepend on the type of roof and the nature of\\nthe work to be undertaken.\\n\\n7.1.1 Flat roofs\\n\\nFlat roofs include those with a pitch of\\nup to 10°. All the edges and openings on a\\nroof from or through which there is a possible\\nfall of more than 2 m should be protected with\\nsuitable guard-rails and toe boards erected to\\nthe same standard as described in Chapter 5\\nfor scaffolding (figures 22 and 23). In the case\\nof openings, the alternative is to provide a\\nsubstantial cover which will bear your weight,\\nand which is not easily moved. It must be\\nboldly and clearly marked as to its purpose. If\\nthere is an upstand at the edge of the roof of\\nsufficient strength, conventional scaffold\\ntubes to support guard-rails and toe boards\\ncan be attached to this. Alternatively, a system\\nof simple precast counterweights can be used\\nto support edge protection, or a series of\\ntriangular tubular steel frames approximately\\n2.4 m apart and using conventional scaffold\\ntubes can be anchored to the roof, again by\\nprecast concrete counterweights.\\n\\nFigure 22. Edge protection for flat roof — diagram of what is required\\n\\n33\\n\\n[Page 39]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nFigure 23. Edge protection for flat roof — a real-life example\\n\\n7.1.2 Sloping roofs\\n\\nEdge protection is necessary for all\\nsloping roofs, that is of more than 10° pitch, or\\nwhich have a slippery surface and where there\\nis the possibility of a fall of more than 2 m\\nfrom the edge of the roof. It should take the\\nform of barriers or guard-rails high enough\\nand strong enough to stop you if you are\\nrolling or sliding down the roof slope (figure\\n24). The roof surface may be slippery because\\nof the material from which the roof is\\nconstructed or because of the growth of moss\\nor lichen, or it may quickly become slippery\\nafter rain or snow.\\n\\nUnless tile battens on a roof are of\\nadequate strength and themselves provide\\nadequate handholds and footholds, you should\\nuse purpose-made crawling ladders or\\ncrawling boards (figure 25), even for\\ninspection or work of short duration.\\n\\n34\\n\\n7.1.3 Fragile roofs\\n\\nBefore you use any roof as a means of\\naccess or a place of work, make sure that no\\npart is covered with fragile material. Some\\nroof coverings give a false sense of security\\nand the impression of a surface which is solid\\nenough to bear your weight, but they will not\\ncarry a concentrated load such as that applied\\nby the heel of your foot, or if you stumble or\\nfall. A common example is single-thickness\\nasbestos cement sheeting which may shatter\\nwithout warning. Do not make the common\\nmistake of believing that it is safe to walk\\nalong the lines of sheeting bolts. Other\\nexamples of fragile material are wired glass,\\ncorrugated plastic sheeting for roof lights,\\nrusted corrugated iron sheeting and\\nunreinforced insulating slabs. Sometimes\\nfragile materials are not easily recognizable\\nbeneath a paint or tar covering, particularly\\nwhen they have been used to patch or repair a\\nroof.\\n\\n[Page 40]\\nHazardous processes\\n\\nOnce fragile material has been\\nidentified, or if you are in any doubt, use at\\nleast two crawling boards or roof ladders, so\\nthat one is available to stand on while you are\\nmoving the other.\\n\\nSpecial precautions are necessary where\\na valley or parapet gutter is used as a means of\\naccess and the adjacent roof is covered with\\nfragile material. Covering, or guard-rails,\\nshould be provided to prevent you from falling\\nthrough if you slip or stumble. Prominent\\nwarning notices should be displayed at the\\napproaches to fragile roofs.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\ne Never work on a roof which is without\\nadequate edge protection.\\n\\ne Before you work on a roof make sure\\n\\nyou know which parts are made of\\nfragile material.\\n\\ne Never step on to a fragile roof.\\n\\nFigure 24.

Roof ladder with ridge iron to place over\\nroof ridge\\n\\n7.2 Steel erection\\n\\nThe erection of steel structures and\\nbuilding frames involves work at heights and\\nin exposed positions. The incidence rates for\\ninjury and death of steel erection workers are\\nmuch greater than those for workers in the\\nconstruction industry as a whole, high as these\\nare.\\n\\nBecause the time spent at individual\\nworkpoints is often relatively short, access\\nscaffolding is frequently not used and steel\\nerectors perform many tasks in unnecessarily\\ndangerous situations, often from a mistaken\\nbelief in their own invulnerability.\\n\\n7.2.1 Design planning\\n\\nIf you work in steel erection you should\\nknow what safety precautions should always\\nbe taken before you begin work on site. It is\\nessential that safety in steel erection begins at\\nthe design stage. Designers of structural\\nsteelwork should have — sufficient _ site\\nexperience to understand fully the problems of\\n\\n37\\n\\nsteel erection, such as joint positions affecting\\nerection sequences, the accessibility of\\nconnections, fixings for working platforms,\\nand means of access and weights in relation to\\ncrane capacity. Designers should provide\\nsufficient information so that the erection\\ncontractor is aware of the precautions which\\nneed to be taken to ensure the stability of the\\nsteelwork during erection. The contractor in\\nturn should provide a statement of the\\nproposed erection method and submit this to\\nthe designer for acceptance. A safe method of\\nwork includes the identification of hazards\\nand difficulties which could lead to departures\\nfrom the planned sequence of erection.\\n\\n7.2.2 Supervision\\n\\nBecause fabricators and erectors of\\nstructural steelwork are often from different\\ncompanies, there is the need for a supervisor\\nfrom the main contractor to ensure that all\\nprocedures, checks and inspections are carried\\nout, including clearance of any modifications\\nor changes introduced.\\n\\n7.2.3 Work preparation\\n\\nBecause erection of steelwork usually\\ntakes place during the early stages of a project\\nbefore the site has been cleared and prepared,\\narrangements for the storage and handling of\\nprefabricated steelwork are frequently\\nhaphazard, and there is often no proper access\\nand freedom of movement for transport and\\ncranes. Prior construction of ground-floor\\nconcrete slabs, access roads and hardstandings\\nwill encourage the use of cranes, tower\\nscaffolds and mobile platforms, and provide a\\ncleaner and safer site. The layout of the\\nstorage area for steelwork and materials needs\\nto be arranged so that vehicles and cranes can\\nmove about without fear of collision.\\n\\nTo assist in safe lifting and movement\\nof structural steelwork by crane, or by guy\\nand pole derricks where cranes cannot be\\nused, there should be clear indications of the\\nweight of components and, wherever possible,\\nmarkings giving suitable slinging points. Use\\n\\n[Page 43]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nshould be made, wherever practicable, of hand\\nlines attached to any item being moved.\\n\\nThe weather should be constantly\\nmonitored in relation both to wind and rain.\\nThere is danger in using cranes in high winds,\\nand in working on steelwork in high winds and\\non wet surfaces.\\n\\nHolding-down bolts are usually provided\\nand fixed before the steel erectors arrive, and\\ntheir importance is often underestimated.\\nErrors in position, alignment and level can\\nlead to improvization, and careful checking is\\nnecessary before erection begins. During the\\nearly stage of construction, excess loadings\\ncan be applied to the bolts and there is a\\ndanger of collapse unless adequate temporary\\nbracing is provided in the form of props or\\nguys. Many of the collapses which occur are\\ncaused either by failing to use adequate\\nbracing, or by departing from _ planned\\narrangements to ensure stability. Erection\\nplanning should include the provision of\\nsufficient guys, props, bracings and temporary\\nconnections.\\n\\nDuring steel erection by crane, two hand\\nlines should always be attached at each end of\\nthe steelwork. Workers controlling the\\nplacement of the steelwork using these hand\\nlines should be positioned at a safe distance at\\nleast 5 m away from the point of placement.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\ne Trying to save crane time by reducing\\nthe number of bolts used in connections\\nis a dangerous practice.\\n\\ne Do not work in high winds or on wet\\nsteelwork.\\n\\n7.2.4 Means of access to working areas\\n\\nBecause of the mistaken belief that steel\\nerectors are in a special class, able to rely on\\ntheir skill to take care of themselves in all\\nsituations, dangerous practices such as\\nclimbing bare steel, beam walking (feet on top\\n\\n38\\n\\nflange) and straddling (feet on lower flanges)\\nare commonplace. In general, there are no\\ntechnical or practical difficulties to prevent\\nthe provision and use of working platforms,\\nstagings and working positions for the use of\\nerectors working on the structural framework.\\nIn the majority of cases work can be planned\\nand platforms designed to be attached at\\nground level, raised with the components and\\nremoved by crane after use. Often there is no\\nreason why ladders fixed to stanchions before\\nerection should not be used for vertical access.\\nIf they are attached to lugs fixed to the\\nsteelwork you need not be at risk when the\\nladders are removed, e.g. by being lifted out\\nby crane after slings have been attached.\\n\\nProject planning should always include\\nthe earliest possible provision of horizontal\\naccess between points of structural frames by\\nmeans of permanent staircases and walkways\\ncomplete with guard-rails. Prior to this, long-\\nspan metal or timber stagings should be used\\nto provide temporary gangways. Where work\\nis proceeding above 6 m, or two storeys high,\\nthen a tightly planked temporary floor should\\nbe installed. Mobile scaffold towers and\\nmobile hydraulic extending platforms can\\noften be used with greatly improved safety\\n(figure 27), particularly if the site is cleared,\\naccess routes are provided and ground floor\\nslabs and temporary floors are laid as soon as\\npracticable.\\n\\nIf sufficient anchorage points are\\nprovided and used correctly, safety nets,\\nsafety belts and harnesses can save lives or\\nprevent serious injury from falls, and their\\noverall advantages outweigh any possible\\ninconveniences (figure 28). A harness should\\nbe used in preference to a belt. A safety net\\nshould always be installed when the potential\\nfall is more than two storeys (figure 29).\\n\\nSteel erection involves a good deal of\\nmanual handling and _ lifting activities\\nresulting in many back injuries and the\\ntrapping of hands or feet. You require proper\\ntraining in safe methods of handling and\\n\\n[Page 44]\\nHazardous processes\\n\\nlifting, and you should always wear suitable Figure 27.

However, there are\\nvital steps which must be taken by\\nmanagement before you arrive on site.\\n\\nDemolition must be supervised by\\npersons with a thorough knowledge not only\\nof demolition processes but of the principles\\nof building construction. First, a survey of the\\nphysical characteristics and design of the\\nbuilding to be demolished must be carried out\\nin order to choose a safe method of work.\\nContained within the structure of buildings\\nare various forces and stresses, whether the\\nbuildings be of concrete, brick, masonry, steel\\nor timber. When the building is complete,\\nthese forces and reactions are in balance, and\\n\\n41\\n\\nequilibrium and stability is achieved. The\\nseverance or removal of a_ load-carrying\\nmember may unbalance the forces, upset the\\nequilibrium and cause collapse of the whole\\nor that part of the building. There are\\nparticular problems in some newer buildings\\nwhich are  post-tensioned or unbonded\\nstressed structures, or are structures which\\nhave been progressively stressed as\\nconstruction proceeds. Preliminary inquiries\\nof the client or local authority may reveal such\\nproblems. The proposals for demolition\\nshould be contained in a written method\\nstatement which should also include drawings\\nor sketches showing the sequence of\\noperations, and the machinery or equipment to\\nbe used, including personal protective\\nequipment.\\n\\nDemolition is an inherently dangerous\\nprocess and you and everyone on site must\\nwear personal protective equipment (PPE)\\nincluding helmet, gloves and safety footwear\\n(see Chapter 12). The presence of debris and\\ndust, and such jobs as the cutting of bolts or\\nrivets, call for the provision of eye protection\\nsuch as goggles or visors. The use of PPE is\\nan essential part of your training in the basic\\nprinciples and methods of safe demolition.\\n\\nBefore demolition begins, all services to\\nthe building or _ structure must be\\ndisconnected. Failure to do this adequately\\ncan result in electric shock, gasing, fire,\\nexplosions or flooding. Arrangements should\\nbe made to keep the public as far away as\\npossible from the site, and wherever\\npracticable a fence not less than 2 m high\\nshould be erected around it.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\n* Plan before you demolish and demolish\\naccording to plan.\\n\\nHave a written method statement for\\nyour demolition site.\\n\\n[Page 47]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n7.4.2 The demolition process\\n\\nThe aim should be to adopt methods\\nwhich do not expose you to falls from\\nheights. While in general it is a sound rule\\ngradually to reduce the height of a building\\nand to demolish in the reverse order to\\nconstruction, a deliberately engineered\\ncollapse, the licensed use of explosives, a\\ndemolition ball on a crane, or a pusher arm\\nmay sometimes be the quickest and most\\neconomical method of demolition, leaving\\nwork to be completed at ground level. It is\\ndangerous to leave isolated wails or parts of\\nwalls standing and liable to collapse from the\\neffect of high winds. Whatever the process\\nadopted, debris should not be allowed to build\\nup against walls or on floors with the\\nconsequent risk of the structure being\\nunintentionally overloaded. Make use of\\ndebris chutes rather than throwing down\\n\\nmaterial indiscriminately, even on isolated\\nsites.\\n\\nWherever practicable, avoid working\\ndirectly from parts of the building or structure\\nyou are demolishing, such as standing on the\\ntop of a brick wall. This usually means that\\nyou have both poor handholds and poor\\nfootholds.\\n\\nWhen work cannot safely be carried out\\nfrom a building, a scaffold platform, self-\\nsupporting and independent of the part of the\\nbuilding being demolished, should be\\nprovided (figure 30). On brick and masonry\\nstructures in particular, much of the work can\\nbe done from such scaffolding, the material\\nbeing dropped to the interior of the building.\\nPerson-carrying skips or power-operated\\nmobile work platforms can also be used to\\nwork at heights. The use of safety nets or\\nsafety harnesses may sometimes be necessary.\\n\\nFigure 30. A scaffold platform from which demolition may be carried out safely\\n\\n42\\n\\n[Page 48]\\nHazardous processes\\n\\n7.4.3 Tanks and vessels\\n\\nThe use of hot processes such as flame-\\ncutting to demolish or dismantle plant which\\nhas contained flammable materials has caused\\nmany deaths and serious injuries. It is\\nessential to make such tanks and vessels safe\\nbefore work commences, and you should\\nalways follow a written permit-to-work\\nsystem. It is usually easier to ensure that a\\nflammable concentration of vapour is not\\npresent in a tank than it is to remove residues.\\nResidue fires during demolition are common.\\nIn the case of small vessels up to about 50\\ncubic metres capacity both vapours and\\nresidues can usually be removed by steaming\\nout, but this is often impracticable for larger\\nvessels. The nature and distribution of\\nresidues is thus a key factor in deciding on the\\ntechniques to be used. Remember that there\\nare other ways of cutting tanks and drums by\\nmeans of cold processes and these should be\\nconsidered before you adopt a hot process.\\n\\n7.4.4 Health hazards\\n\\nInsidious and unexpected health hazards\\nfrequently arise during demolition on account\\nof exposure to dust and fumes. Short-term\\neffects of poisonous fumes, or acute gasing,\\narise when a plant is opened up without\\nhaving first been properly isolated, purged or\\ncleaned, or when a vessel is entered without\\ntaking precautions. Another cause is the\\nflame-cutting of plant which has been painted\\nwith zinc or cadmium paint. Long-term or\\nsystemic poisonings arise from flame-cutting\\nlead-painted steelwork, and from _ the\\ninhalation of dust or fumes from chemical\\ndeposits. The site survey should have\\nassessed the risk, and the method of work\\nstatement should set out permit-to-work\\nsystems, the use of breathing apparatus,\\napproved respirators, and rescue equipment.\\n\\nExposure to asbestos-bearing materials\\nis now a particular risk in demolition. Indeed,\\nyou may be said to be more at risk from the\\npresence of asbestos than almost any other\\ncategory of worker. This applies particularly\\n\\n43\\n\\nto exposure to blue asbestos, which was\\ncommonly used in sprayed insulation on\\ncolumns and on the underside of ceilings and\\nroofs for fire protection or for thermal\\ninsulation. Stringent precautions need to be\\ntaken to avoid contaminating the general\\natmosphere and to prevent breathing in of the\\ndust. Material containing asbestos must be\\nremoved in isolation from other work, and\\nyou must wear positive pressure breathing\\napparatus and protective clothing, and be\\ntrained in their use and the techniques of\\nasbestos removal (see Chapter 12). Where\\npossible, wet methods of asbestos removal\\nshould be adopted rather than dry methods.\\nSpecial arrangements need to be made by\\nmanagement for the safe disposal of asbestos-\\ncontaminated debris.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\ne Never work on a tank or enclosed\\nvessel without a written permit to\\nwork.\\n\\nAlways check whether asbestos is\\npresent in the building to be\\ndemolished.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n¢ What should be done before demolition\\nbegins?\\n\\n* How should demolition proceed?\\n\\n¢ What are the common dangers to your\\nsafety and what precautions would you\\ntake?\\n\\n* What are the special dangers to your health\\nand what precautions would you take?\\n\\n7.5 Confined spaces\\n\\n7.5.1 Hazards\\n\\nEvery year there are fatal and serious\\naccidents caused by persons entering confined\\nspaces without the necessary tests being\\n\\n[Page 49]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\ncarried out or the correct safety and rescue\\nequipment being provided. In many cases\\nattempted rescue has ended in tragedy, with\\nthe death of the poorly equipped rescuer as\\nwell as the person to be rescued. While a\\nclosed tank with a restricted access opening\\nmay be the obvious example of a confined\\nspace, such spaces may also include open\\nmanholes, sewers, trenches, bored piles,\\npipes, ducts, enclosed basements and other\\nplaces where there is inadequate ventilation.\\n\\nDangerous atmospheres can arise when\\nthere is a lack of oxygen or when toxic or\\nflammable gases are present. These may be\\ndue to exhaust gases from plant and transport,\\ncarbon dioxide forming in chalk soil,\\ndecomposition of sludge in a sewer, leaks\\nfrom gas mains, rusting of metalwork, or the\\npresence of petrol and various kinds of waste\\nfrom factories and trade premises. Work\\nbeing done in a confined space can make it\\ndangerous. Examples are some painting work,\\nthe use of adhesives to fix floor tiles, and\\ncleaning fluids.\\n\\nMany of these accidents would have\\nbeen avoided if supervisors and workers had\\nbeen properly trained and a permit to enter\\nand a permit to work system had been in\\noperation.\\n\\nIf you are actively engaged in work in\\nconfined spaces, you must be fit and properly\\ntrained for the job, and have the necessary\\npersonal protective equipment. You should\\nremember that an oxygen deficiency can\\nrender you unconscious, and that toxic fumes\\ncan additionally cause dizziness and a feeling\\nof sickness, while gases can be flammable or\\nexplosive.\\n\\n7.5.2 Safety precautions\\n\\nThe following precautions are essential\\nbefore you enter a confined space regardless\\nof any work you intend to carry out:\\n\\n— Never enter without instructions from a\\nsupervisor and without a written permit to\\nenter or permit to work.\\n\\n44\\n\\nEquipment for monitoring the atmosphere\\nat frequent intervals must be provided and\\nmust be used by a competent person. You\\nmust not enter the confined space until the\\ncompetent person is satisfied that entry is\\nsafe.\\n\\nThere should be forced ventilation to\\nremove and dilute dangerous gases and\\nprovide fresh air.\\n\\nMonitoring must continue while work\\nproceeds, and you must leave immediately\\nif told to do so.\\n\\nYou should have received proper training\\nand instruction in the precautions to be\\ntaken, including the use of emergency\\nbreathing apparatus.\\n\\nRescue harnesses should be worn by\\neveryone inside the confined space, with\\nlifelines attached to a point outside the\\nspace.\\n\\nNot less than two persons should be\\npresent when there is work in a confined\\nspace. One should be outside the confined\\nspace to keep watch and to offer rescue\\naction or assistance. Additional emergency\\nand accident assistance must also be\\nreadily available.\\n\\nA proper procedure for rescue in an\\nemergency should be laid down, with\\nspecific duties allocated to specific\\npersons.

A check\\nshould be made to ensure there are no\\ncellars, underground water courses or\\nground conditions which might cause\\nhazards;\\n\\nthere should be a firm level base for the\\ncrane, or crane mats provided;\\n\\nwhen working on piling operations you must\\nwear a safety helmet, and ear and eye\\nprotection where necessary;\\n\\nall cranes, lifting appliances and lifting gear\\nmust have appropriate certificates of testing\\nand thorough examination, and should be\\nlarge enough for the job;\\n\\nparticular attention should be paid to the risk\\nof damage to lifting gear from sharp edges;\\n\\ncranes used for raising or lowering workers\\nmust be fitted with a dead man’s handle and\\nlowering should be done under power; you\\nmust be carried in properly constructed\\ncages which cannot spin or tip;\\n\\npiling contractors should be asked to provide\\na written method statement setting out the\\nprecautions relevant to the type of piling\\nthey are to employ;\\n\\ninduction training and information for you\\nas supervisor or operative should be\\nspecifically related to the method statement.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ Wear your protective equipment at all\\ntimes when piling.\\n\\n46\\n\\n7.6.2 Bored piles\\n\\nYou may need to enter a borehole for\\ninspection or for clearing out in undercuts,\\nand there are certain precautions which must\\nbe taken prior to your entry:\\n\\nthe borehole should be at least 75 cm in\\ndiameter;\\n\\nthe borehole should be treated as a confined\\nspace and the precautions which are advised\\nelsewhere to ensure a satisfactory\\natmosphere must be closely followed;\\n\\nwaste material from the borehole should be\\nkept clear of the borehole;\\n\\ndescent into a borehole should be in\\nproperly designed skips, chains or cages\\nfitted with an anti-spin device. The power\\nsource of the lifting appliance should be\\nkept running throughout the time someone\\nis underground;\\n\\nwhile you are working down a borehole you\\nmust wear a safety harness;\\n\\nall workers concerned must be trained and\\ncompetent in rescue from deep boreholes,\\nand emergency rescue drills should be\\ncarried out at regular intervals;\\n\\na banksman who can see you in the\\nborehole should be present at all times;\\n\\nthere must be adequate lighting at safe\\nreduced voltage and a means of\\ncommunication from the borehole.\\n\\nWherever possible, the need for workers\\nto enter pile boreholes should be avoided by\\nthe use of television cameras and other\\ntechniques for remote inspection.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n¢ What are the dangers of piling and what\\nshould be done to overcome them?\\n\\n[Page 52]\\n8. Vehicles\\n\\n8.1 Causes of accidents\\n\\nThe underlying cause of most site traffic\\naccidents is the failure to plan a safe system of\\nwork and to train workers how to follow it.\\nHowever, the common immediate causes are\\none or a combination of the following factors:\\n\\nbad driving techniques which include\\nreversing blind;\\n\\ncarelessness or ignorance of special\\nhazards, e.g. work near overhead power\\nlines or excavations;\\n\\ncarrying unauthorized passengers;\\npoor maintenance of vehicles;\\noverloading or bad loading;\\n\\nsite congestion;\\n\\npoor traffic layout;\\n\\nlack of proper roadways combined with\\nuneven ground and debris.\\n\\n8.2 Safety precautions\\n\\nTransport may include trucks, tipper\\nlorries, tractors and trailers, and small\\ndumpers. As a driver you must be properly\\ntrained and if you take a vehicle on or across a\\npublic road you usually need to possess a\\nnational driving licence. It is good practice for\\nall drivers to possess a driving licence in any\\ncase. Training should include instruction on\\nnegotiating steep slopes so that you know, for\\nexample, that you should drive a vehicle up\\nand down the slope rather than across it,\\nwhenever practicable.\\n\\nRoutes should be levelled, marked and\\nplanned in such a way as to avoid potential\\nhazards such as overhead power lines and\\nsteeply sloping ground. Where possible a one-\\nway system should be used. Speed limits\\nshould be required and clearly displayed, they\\nshould be reduced for adverse site conditions\\nand for areas near work in progress.\\n\\n47\\n\\nIf routes have to approach overhead\\nstructures or overhead power lines, contact\\nwith them can be avoided by erecting warning\\nbarriers of the goalpost type (figure 32). The\\ncrossbar should be of rigid material,\\npreferably timber, and painted in two\\ncontrasting warning colours. In the case of\\npower lines, there should be a barrier on both\\nsides of the line and set at least 6 m horizontal\\ndistance away. If you are operating a crane in\\nthe area of overhead power lines, make sure\\nthat arrangements have been made in advance\\nwith the power company for power to be\\ndiverted or cut off whenever the crane is in\\nuse.\\n\\nWorkers are frequently struck by\\nvehicles travelling backwards when the\\ndriver’s rear view is obscured. Enlist the help\\nof another worker before you reverse and keep\\nhim or her in view at all times. If no one is\\navailable, walk round to the rear of the vehicle\\nyourself to see that all is clear and give a\\nsound signal before starting to reverse. Many\\nvehicles now have an audible warning device\\nsuch as a horn or warning hooter which\\nsounds when reverse gear is engaged, but as a\\ndriver you should not rely on this alone.\\n\\nAn unattended vehicle should have the\\nengine switched off, and unless the vehicle is\\non a marked incline the gear should be left in\\nneutral and the handbrake on, on sloping\\nground the wheels should also be chocked.\\nTipping bodies should be lowered when the\\nmachine is unattended, but if it is occasionally\\nnecessary to leave them in the raised position\\nthey should be blocked to prevent their fall.\\n\\nFoot injuries to drivers and_ their\\nassistants during loading and unloading are\\ncommon, and you should wear safety boots or\\nshoes.\\n\\nMaintenance of vehicles falls into three\\ncategories:\\n\\n[Page 53]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n— adaily check by the driver of water, oil,\\nfuel, lights, inflation of tyres and brakes —\\nremember the acronym WOFLIB;\\n\\n— aweekly check by a fitter;\\n\\n— periodic servicing to the manufacturers’\\nrequirements.\\n\\nA written record of maintenance and\\nrepairs should be kept on site.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\n* Keep your vehicle tidy and the cab free\\nfrom tools and material which might\\n\\nobstruct the controls.\\n\\nKeep to speed limits.\\n\\nDo not carry unauthorized passengers.\\nDo not drive across a slope.\\n\\nFigure 32. Goalposts to compel drivers to lower crane and excavator jibs, and\\navoid contact with overhead power lines\\n\\nat oes oe\\n\\n8.3 Overturning\\n\\nFalls of vehicles into excavations or\\nopenings occur frequently when vehicles get\\ntoo near the edge of an excavation and cause\\nthe side to cave in, or when in tipping\\nmaterials over the edge the driver approaches\\ntoo close and cannot stop in time. The\\nprecautions are barriers, banksmen and fixed\\nstops, as discussed in Chapter 4. Construction\\nvehicles are often basically unstable and liable\\nto overturn, and it is therefore important not to\\nturn at an excessive speed. Vehicles such as\\ntractors and lift trucks should be equipped with\\n\\n48\\n\\nprotection to prevent the driver being hit by\\nfalling objects and from being thrown from\\nthe cab in the event of overturning.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ If your vehicle begins to topple over,\\n\\nremain in the seat and do not try to\\njump clear.\\n\\n[Page 54]\\nVehicles\\n\\n8.4 Loading\\n\\nLoads within the capacity of the vehicle\\nshould be evenly distributed and properly\\nsecured, and should not project beyond the\\nplan area of the vehicle. If some degree of\\nprojection is unavoidable, it should be clearly\\nshown by the attachment of flags. Uneven\\nloading can cause a loss of control when\\ncornering or braking, and insecure loads may\\nswerve or fall off the vehicle during travel.\\nThe body of a tipper lorry should always be\\nlowered before you drive off.\\n\\nLoading and unloading should be an\\nintegral part of driver training.\\n\\n49\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\n¢ Use the steps if fitted, otherwise use the\\nwheel rims to dismount from the cab;\\n\\ndo not jump.\\n\\nNever mount, or dismount from, a\\nmoving vehicle.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n¢ What are the principal reasons for site\\nvehicle accidents?\\n\\n¢ What further precautions to those\\nmentioned can you take to prevent site\\nvehicle accidents?\\n\\n[Page 55]\\n\\n\\n[Page 56]\\n9. Movement of materials\\n\\n9.1 Cranes\\n\\nBefore a crane is used on _ site,\\nmanagement should consider all the factors\\nthat could affect its safe use, such as:\\n\\nthe weight, size and type of load it will have\\nto lift;\\n\\nthe maximum reach or radius required of it;\\nrestrictions on use such as overhead power\\nlines, the state of the site and the type of\\nground;\\n\\nthe need for trained operators and\\nsignallers.\\n\\n9.1.1 Erection\\n\\nBoth the erection and dismantling of\\ncranes should be done by skilled workers\\nunder the immediate direction of a competent\\nand experienced supervisor. The\\nmanufacturers’ instructions should be closely\\nfollowed.\\n\\n9.1.2 Signalling\\n\\nCrane operators and signallers must be\\nover the age of 18, and trained and sufficiently\\nexperienced. There should always be a\\nsignaller, or a signalling system such as a\\ntelephone, if the crane operator cannot see the\\nload throughout the lift. Hand signals should\\nbe clear and distinct, and should follow a\\nrecognized code or system (figure 33).\\n\\n9.1.3 Overloading\\n\\nOverloading, causing vital parts to be\\nstressed beyond rated capacities, can easily\\noccur when neither the operator nor the\\nsupervisor is able to estimate the weight of\\nmaterial to be lifted, which is likely in the case\\nof odd-shaped items. An operator who is not\\nproperly trained may then lower a load at too\\nhigh a speed so that when the brake is abruptly\\napplied the jib snaps. All cranes should be\\nmarked with their safe working load which\\n\\n51\\n\\nmust not be exceeded during the use of the\\ncrane. In the case of cranes with a derricking\\njib, that is with a variable operating radius, the\\nsafe working load should be shown for every\\nradius of the jib. Winches and pulley blocks\\nshould be similarly marked.\\n\\nFigure 33. Hand signals to crane drivers should be\\nclear and distinct, and should follow a\\nrecognized code or system\\n\\nSIGNAL CHART\\n\\nSTOP AT ONCE (DANGER)\\n\\nSIGNAL NOT UNDERSTOOD\\n\\n9.1.4 Safe load indicators\\n\\nAll jib cranes should have an automatic\\nsafe load indicator which alerts the operator,\\nusually by a light, just before the safe load is\\nreached, and warns both the operator and\\nothers nearby, usually by a bell or hooter, if\\nthe safe load is exceeded. The safe load\\n\\n[Page 57]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nindicator is an aid to safe crane operation, but\\ndoes not guarantee it. For example, it does not\\ntake into account the effect of wind or soft\\nground conditions. If you are lifting a load that\\nyou know or believe to be close to the safe\\nworking load, do not proceed immediately to a\\nfull lift. Rather raise the load a short distance\\nand stop to check the stability of the crane\\nbefore continuing with the lift. Remember that\\nif a load is allowed to swing or is lowered\\nrapidly, the radius of the jib may be increased\\nunintentionally by flexing of the jib. Some\\nindicators operate also as an overload cut-out.\\nNever bypass the indicator in order to lift an\\noverload.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\n* Ifyou cannot see the load all the time,\\nyou need a signaller.\\n\\n* Beware of exceeding the safe working\\nload when trying to free a stuck load.\\n\\n9.1.5 Inspection and maintenance\\n\\nCranes are subject to wear and tear\\nwhich may not be easily detected: for example,\\nbolts and similar parts may be subject to metal\\nfatigue. Cranes should be tested and examined\\nby a competent person before they are used on\\na construction site, and subsequently inspected\\nat regular intervals in accordance’ with\\ngovernment requirements. The manufacturer’s\\nrecommended programmes of operator checks\\nand maintenance should be followed and any\\ndamage or defect should be reported to the\\nsupervisor. Never use a crane if you think it\\nunsafe.\\n\\nParticularly susceptible components are\\nwire ropes, brakes and safety devices. The\\nconstant contact of wire ropes with the sheaves\\non the jib accelerates wear. Brakes are in\\nconstant use and need to be checked, adjusted\\nor renewed regularly. Safe load indicators and\\nother safety devices such as overload cut-outs\\nand limit switches are often susceptible to\\n\\n52\\n\\nbreakdown under site conditions and are\\nsometimes deliberately disconnected.\\n\\n9.1.6 Mobile cranes\\n\\nA mobile crane is inherently unstable\\nand is liable to overturn if used on\\nuncompacted ground or on a_¥-é slope.\\nRemember that rain can soften the ground and\\nsites which are not level impose strains on the\\ncrane which may lead to unintentional\\noverloading.\\n\\nFrom your training as a crane operator\\nyou should understand the advantages and\\nlimitations of outrigger settings (figure 34),\\nand be aware of the dangers of failing to use\\nthem. Lifting outdoors may be made more\\ndifficult or hazardous by the wind. Make sure\\nthat there is adequate clearance for the crane’s\\njib or boom and counterweight from traffic\\nand fixed structures such as buildings, and\\nthat no part of the crane or the crane load will\\nbe closer than 4 m to live overhead power\\nlines.\\n\\nFigure 34. Mobile cranes should operate with\\noutriggers extended to prevent\\noverturning\\n\\n[Page 58]\\nMovement of materials\\n\\nAll cranes should be fitted with a safety\\nhook designed to prevent accidental\\ndislodgement of the load if it fouls something\\nor meets an obstruction during the lift (figure\\n35).\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\nIs there a safety hook fitted?\\nIs there adequate clearance for the\\n\\ncrane’s jig or boom?\\nMake sure there are no drainpipes\\nbeneath the outrigger pads.\\n\\nFigure 35. Cranes: The need for a safety hook fitted with a latch to prevent displacement of loads is\\n\\nexplained to workers\\n\\n1\\neer rofl AIITLAITE\\n\\n9.1.7 Tower cranes\\n\\nTo prevent overturning, a tower crane\\nmust either be anchored to the ground or\\nsecurely counterweighted or ballasted. If the\\ncrane is rail mounted, remember that the rail\\ntracks cannot be used as an anchor. Because\\nballast material may be moved, a diagram of\\nthe counterweight or ballast should be fixed to\\nthe crane, and the ballast should be checked\\nagainst this whenever the crane is erected, and\\nafter bad weather.\\n\\n53\\n\\nMake sure that equipment such as slings\\nand chains used with the crane does not clutter\\naccessways or ladders and is well clear of any\\nmachinery in which it may become entangled.\\n\\nLoads must be lifted vertically, as any\\nout-of-vertical lifting may result in crane\\ncollapse. Never lift loads having a large\\nsurface area in windy conditions.\\n\\nThe crane must be positioned to ensure\\nthat the crane jib or boom is free to windvane\\n\\n[Page 59]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nor turn through 360° around the tower. Crane\\nmanufacturers specify the maximum wind\\nspeed at which tower cranes may be safely\\nused.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ Never climb up the tower or get onto\\nthe boom while the crane is in use.\\n\\n9.1.8 Cranes used in demolition\\n\\nA cast-steel ball or weight suspended\\nfrom a crane jib is an extensively used method\\nof demolition. Cranes as such are not designed\\nfor extremes of shock loading likely to arise\\nwhen a demolition ball is in use and therefore\\nshould be used only to drop the ball vertically\\non a free fall for such operations as breaking\\nup concrete slabs. They should not be used for\\nswinging the ball. Excavators which are\\nconvertible to cranes are designed for drag-line\\noperations which impose a shock load and are\\nmore suited to use with a ball. The excavator\\nmanufacturer’s recommendations as to weight\\nand attachment of the ball should be followed.\\nGenerally the weight of the demolition ball\\nshould not be more than 33 per cent of the\\nmachine’s safe working load and not exceed\\n10 per cent of the hoist rope’s minimum\\nbreaking load. All parts should be inspected\\ntwice daily, and a _ high standard of\\nmaintenance is necessary. As an operator you\\nneed to be familiar with demolition balling and\\nshould be protected from debris by a\\nprotective structure with safety glass or metal\\nmesh.\\n\\n9.1.9 Lifting appliances used as cranes\\n\\nMachines such as excavators, back-hoe\\ndiggers and front-end loaders are used as\\ncranes when they handle loads suspended by\\nslings.\\n\\nThe precautions previously advised for\\nmobile cranes apply in general, although a safe\\nload indicator and a radius indicator are not\\n\\n54\\n\\ngenerally fitted if the load lifted is kept below\\n1 tonne. Whatever the load, you should ensure\\nthat the machine can safely lift and place it\\nexactly where needed.\\n\\n9.1.10 Slings and ropes\\n\\nOnly slings and ropes which have a\\nmarked safe working load should be used. Pad\\nsharp corners of the load to prevent damage to\\nthe sling and make sure you have screwed\\nhome the shackle pins.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ Make sure the load you are lifting is\\nproperly secured.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n* How would you describe a crane?\\n\\n¢ What site conditions make it unsafe to use\\na crane?\\n\\n¢ What are the safety devices used on\\ncranes?\\n\\n* What types of lifting machinery are subject\\nto inspection and testing?\\n\\n¢ What should inspection and testing consist\\nof and how often should they be done?\\n\\n9.2 Goods hoists\\n\\nThe goods, or platform, hoist used to\\nraise materials and equipment vertically to\\nsuccessive levels as construction proceeds is\\nprobably the most widely used item of\\nmechanical handling equipment. It consists of\\na platform which is driven either from a rope\\nwinch or by a rack and pinion with the motor\\nand gearbox mounted on the platform. The\\nprincipal dangers are of falling down the\\nhoistway from a landing on the platform,\\nbeing struck by the platform or other moving\\nparts, and being hit by materials falling down\\nthe hoistway.\\n\\n[Page 60]\\nMovement of materials\\n\\n9.2.1 Erection\\n\\nThe erection, extension and dismantling\\nof hoists is a specialized job and you should\\ncarry it out only under the charge of a\\ncompetent supervisor. The tower or mast of\\nthe static hoist needs to be securely tied to a\\nbuilding or scaffold and maintained vertical,\\nso that no undue stress is imposed on the\\ntower, with consequent misalignment and\\ninterference with the platform. Mobile hoists\\nshould be used only to a maximum height of\\n18 m unless a greater height is specified by the\\nmanufacturer.\\n\\n9.2.2 Enclosure\\n\\nA substantial enclosure should be\\nerected at ground level around the hoistway to\\na height of at least 2 m. It should have suitable\\ngates giving access to the platform (figure 36).\\nThe remainder of the hoistway should be\\nenclosed (e.g. with wire mesh) throughout its\\nheight sufficiently to contain falling material\\nwithin the enclosure. Gates should be fitted at\\nevery landing level where access to the\\nplatform is needed, and you must keep the\\ngates closed except when you are actually\\nloading and unloading at that level.\\n\\n9.2.3 Safety devices\\n\\nAn overrun device should be fitted just\\nabove the highest platform position required,\\nor near the top of the mast. An arrestor device\\nshould be fitted to support the platform, fully\\nloaded, in the event of failure of the hoist rope\\nor driving gear. There should be at least three\\nturns of rope on the winch-drum when the\\nplatform is in its lowest position.\\n\\n9.2.4 Operation\\n\\nTo prevent the hoist operator, who\\nshould be trained and aged at least 18, from\\nmoving the platform while someone is trying\\nto load or unload materials, the controls need\\nto be set up so that the hoist can be operated\\nfrom one position only. Make sure that from\\nthis position the operator can see all landing\\n\\n55\\n\\nlevels clearly. If this is not possible, a\\nsignalling system must be used during loading\\nand unloading. There should be overhead\\nprotection for the operator if, as is usually the\\ncase, he or she is at ground level.\\n\\n9.2.5 Loads\\n\\nThe platform should be clearly marked\\nwith its safe working load and the platform\\nshould not be overloaded. Barrows should not\\nbe overfilled, and their wheels should be\\nchocked or secured so that they cannot move\\nabout on the hoist platform while it is moving.\\nLoose bricks or other materials should never\\nbe carried on an open hoist platform. No one\\nshould be allowed to ride on the platform and\\nthere should be a notice on the platform\\nforbidding riding.\\n\\n9.2.6 Carriage of persons\\n\\nLifts for the carriage of persons need to\\nbe especially constructed and installed for the\\npurpose, with such features as mechanical and\\nelectrical interlocking devices on the cage and\\nlanding gates.\\n\\n9.2.7 Testing and examination\\n\\nEvery hoist should be tested and\\nexamined after installation, and checks made\\non the arrester and overrun devices. Weekly\\nrecorded checks should then be made by a\\ncompetent person.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\n¢ Place barrow handles facing the direction\\nof the offloading exit, when loading the\\nplatform on the ground.\\n\\nNever ride on the platform of a goods\\nhoist.\\n\\nKeep the landing gates closed whenever\\nyou are not loading or unloading.\\n\\nMake sure the platform is stopped at the\\nlanding level before you step onto it.\\n\\n[Page 61]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nFigure 36.

A gin wheel should always be secured to\\nat least two supports\\n\\nat tad -.~S\\n\\n9.3.2 Safety measures\\n\\nThe following precautions should be\\ntaken:\\nif liquid is transported in a bucket, there\\nshould always be a cover;\\n\\nwhen you are hoisting the bucket, always\\nuse gloves to protect your hands;\\n\\n57\\n\\n— if the height of the pulley is over 5 m, a\\n\\nratchet and pawl mechanism should be\\n\\nconsidered;\\n\\nwhere the pulley is mounted near the edge\\n\\nof a roof or floor, guard-rails and toe\\n\\nboards are required;\\n\\n— if two or more of you are lifting, one\\nshould give instructions to ensure that the\\nteam works together.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ Make sure that the load you are lifting\\nis properly secured.\\n\\n9.4 Manual handling\\n\\nThe handling of raw materials and\\nbuilding components is an integral part of the\\nconstruction process. Manual handling of\\nloads and materials is still very common.\\nMany workers carry out heavy lifting and\\ncarrying operations during much of the\\nworking day. Next to falls, manual handling is\\nthe most common cause of construction\\naccidents.\\n\\nThe proper mechanical handling of\\nmaterials can ensure that work flows\\nsmoothly, and helps to avoid delays and\\ndamage. In manual materials handling too,\\none can apply techniques and ideas which\\nincrease efficiency and are not expensive.\\nThese “low-cost” solutions most frequently\\narise from local needs and experience.\\n\\nWhen approaching the problem of safe\\nmanual handling of materials there are three\\nimportant questions you should ask:\\n\\n— Can mechanical equipment be used in\\nplace of manual handling?\\n\\n— Can the load be lightened or suitably\\nshaped for manual handling?\\n\\n— Have you been trained in proper methods\\nof lifting and carrying?\\n\\n[Page 63]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n9.4.1 Lifting and carrying\\n\\nAlmost one-quarter of work injuries\\noccur during manual handling, most of which\\nare strains to the hands, legs, feet and back.\\nMuch construction work involves heavy\\nmanual labour and workers not in good\\nphysical condition tire easily and are more\\nsusceptible to injury. You should know your\\nphysical capabilities and only tackle jobs you\\ncan reasonably handle. It is important, too, to\\nhave been trained in the right techniques of\\nlifting and carrying. Look after your own\\nwelfare by:\\n\\n— putting the load on wheels if you can\\ninstead of carrying it;\\n\\n— using mechanical handling equipment if\\nyou have been trained to use it;\\n\\n— wearing the right equipment for the job\\nsuch as safety boots,\\n\\n— checking the weight of the load before\\nlifting;\\n\\n— not lifting loads higher than is necessary;\\n\\n— checking that there are no overhead power\\nlines or obstructions when you are carrying\\na long load such as scaffold tubes or\\nreinforcing rods;\\n\\n— removing or securing loose objects on the\\nload;\\n\\n— getting assistance if the load is too heavy or\\nawkward for you to handle on your own;\\n\\n— making sure that there is a clear walkway to\\nyour destination and a safe stacking place.\\n\\n9.4.2 Lifting technique\\n\\nThe size, shape and structure of the\\nmaterial will largely determine how easy or\\ndifficult manual handling will be. Well-\\ndesigned and well-placed handles are of great\\nhelp. Whenever you lift a load, follow the\\nfollowing procedure:\\n\\n— Stand close to the load on a firm footing\\nand with feet about 30 cm apart.\\n\\n— Bend the knees and keep your back as\\nstraight as you can.\\n\\n— Take a firm grip on the load.\\n\\n— Breathe in and throw the shoulders\\nbackwards.\\n\\n— Straighten the legs, continuing to keep the\\nback as straight as you can.\\n\\n— Make sure that your view is not obstructed\\nby the load.\\n\\n— Keep the load close to the body.\\n\\n— Lift slowly and smoothly.\\n\\n— When carrying a load, avoid twisting the\\nspine to turn; move your feet instead.\\n\\n— Iftwo or more of you are lifting, one\\nshould give instructions to ensure that the\\nteam works together.\\n\\nFigure 38 shows the right and wrong\\nways to lift a load.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n* Correct lifting and carrying calls for\\ntraining and practice.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n¢ What steps can be taken on your site to\\nimprove materials handling?\\n\\n* Have you had training in the correct\\nmethod of lifting and carrying?\\n\\n¢ What handling aids do you have on your\\nsite?\\n\\n[Page 64]\\nMovement of materials\\n\\nFigure 38.

Working positions, tools and equipment\\n\\n10.1 Fitting work to people:\\nErgonomics\\n\\nThe technical development of the\\nconstruction industry has led to reliance on\\nmachines and technical equipment for much\\nheavy work previously done by _ hand.\\nAlthough there are still many tasks on site\\nwhich are carried out using manual labour, it is\\ndifficult to envisage high-rise building\\nconstruction without cranes, excavators,\\nconcrete mixers or pile drivers. Mechanization\\nhas, however, brought new problems to the\\nworkplace.\\n\\nTechnology changes faster than people\\nand technological change often exceeds\\npeople’s ability to adapt. As a construction\\nworker, you know the difference between a\\ntool that is well suited for you and for the job,\\nand one that is not. You also soon become\\naware of the difference between a comfortable\\nworking posture and one _ that is\\nuncomfortable. Ergonomics or human\\nengineering is a multidisciplinary way of\\nlooking at the interrelationship between the\\nworker, the workstation and the working\\nenvironment. Ergonomics plays a key role in\\nthe humanization of work, in increasing\\nproductivity, and in improving safety and\\nhealth.\\n\\nEven with new and modern technologies\\na lot of heavy work is still done by hand.\\nTools, machines and equipment are in many\\ncases old-fashioned, poorly designed or badly\\nmaintained. Many operatives on construction\\nsites are unskilled. Heavy loads frequently\\nhave to be carried up and down stairs, ladders\\nand scaffolds, and people working on\\nconstruction sites often suffer from low back\\npain or injury to muscles and joints.\\n\\nThe construction industry has a wide\\nrange of jobs and processes. These change\\n\\n61\\n\\naccording to the stage of the project. They\\ninvolve consideration of:\\n\\n— working positions, both standing and\\nsitting;\\n\\n— work which is especially strenuous;\\n\\n— the use of hand tools and equipment.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n* How have various machines changed work\\nmethods in the construction industry in the\\npast few years?\\n\\n¢ What are the positive and negative effects\\nof tower cranes and excavators on your\\nwork?\\n\\n10.1.1 Strenuous and heavy physical work\\n\\nContinuous heavy manual work\\nincreases the rate of breathing and the heart. If\\nyou are not in good physical shape, you will\\ntire easily. There are risks involved in\\nworking at maximum physical capacity. The\\nuse of mechanical power to replace heavy\\nwork helps reduce these risks. Mechanical\\npower also helps increase the work\\nopportunities for people with less muscle\\npower. On the other hand, jobs that require no\\nphysical effort are often mentally tiring and\\nboring. It is important that the workload is not\\ntoo heavy and changes during the day.\\nEffective rest periods should always be\\nincluded in the day’s work.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n* Is work affected by differences in workers’\\nheights and weights?\\n\\n* Are there any jobs on your site that\\nworkers try to avoid?\\n\\n¢ Name some jobs which are strenuous. Are\\nthere any alternative methods to carry out\\nthe task with less strain?\\n\\n[Page 67]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n10.1.2 Static loads\\n\\nThe most natural way to work is\\nrhythmically. When sawing with a handsaw,\\nthe hand holding the saw is doing dynamic\\nwork and the other hand static work. This\\n“dynamic” load enables the muscles to\\nalternate between contraction and relaxation. If\\nan object is lifted up and held in this position,\\nthis puts the muscles under a uniform “static”\\nload. Muscles under static load become tired\\nbecause they are continually contracted, and\\nafter a short time the muscles feel painful. A\\nstatic load on the muscles over a long period\\nwill also increase pressure on the heart. The\\npulse increases because the blood remains in\\nthe muscles.\\n\\nOn building sites there are many jobs\\nwhere the worker is exposed to heavy static\\nloading. Finishing work on walls and ceilings,\\npainting and electrical wiring work frequently\\nrequire you to work with arms above your\\nshoulder line, and frequent changes of posture\\nare desirable.\\n\\n10.1.3 Working postures\\n\\nOn construction sites people work in a\\nvariety of different positions. Some workers\\nare climbing up scaffolds, others are using\\nhammers while on their knees, while others\\nare working on surfaces above their heads.\\nUntil recently, little attention has been paid to\\ngood working positions. It is frequently\\nargued that construction work unavoidably\\nrequires many different and changing\\npostures, but it is clear that the principles\\ndeveloped for good working positions in\\nindustry apply also to construction.\\n\\nDifficult working positions lead to\\nspending longer over tasks and lead to fatigue.\\nFor example, working with one’s arms raised\\nrapidly tires the shoulder muscles and work\\nrequiring bending or twisting can easily cause\\nback strain (figure 39). A poor working\\nposture translates into a gradual increase in\\noperation time and an increased possibility of\\ninjury or damage to material or equipment.\\n\\nFigure 39. Where possible, workers should not work on surfaces above their\\nheads, as this increases the strain on arms, back and neck\\n\\n62\\n\\n[Page 68]\\nWorking positions, tools and equipment\\n\\n10.1.4 Sitting and standing positions\\n\\nPosture is defined by the working\\nmethod applied and by the tool in use. When\\nconsidering posture, you have to take into\\naccount the reach and muscular power of the\\nworker involved. Where possible, work should\\nbe done in a sitting position. However, a\\nstanding position is often unavoidable in\\nconstruction work where high muscular power,\\ngreater reach or considerable movement is\\ninvolved.\\n\\nA well-designed workstation provides\\npossibilities for the worker to carry out the\\noperation in many positions and postures, both\\nsitting and standing. It also allows the worker\\nto walk a little during the working day.\\n\\nAlthough there are very few fixed sites\\nin the construction industry, there are many\\noperations where difficult postures can be\\nimproved by simple, low-cost measures. For\\nexample, welders often have awkward\\nworking postures and a simple, light three-\\nlegged stool or chair is useful.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\nArrange to sit whenever possible.\\n\\nKeep materials, tools and controls\\nwithin easy reach.\\n\\nMake sure you got close enough to the\\ntask.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n* Describe several different working postures\\nyou have seen on your site and how they\\ncould be improved.\\n\\n* Hold your hands out straight for a while.\\nHow do you feel?\\n\\n* Bend your body forwards and hold that\\nposition. How do you feel?\\n\\n10.1.5 Work in cabins\\n\\nMachines with cabins for the operator\\nare frequently used on construction sites.\\nExamples include excavators, tower cranes,\\nbulldozers and trucks. In recent years\\nmanufacturers of these machines have paid a\\ngreat deal of attention to the working\\nconditions of the operator. Regular checking\\nand maintenance are needed if these\\nconditions are to remain intact over the\\nworking life of the machine. Here are some\\nkey points to check:\\n\\n— Is there easy access to the cabin?\\n\\n— Are controls in good working order and\\nwithin easy reach?\\n\\n— Is the construction of the cabin solid, are\\nwindows and noise insulation in place, and\\nare lights working?\\n\\n— Is the operator’s seat in good condition,\\nadjustable and securely anchored?\\n\\n— Is the instrumentation functioning?\\n\\n— Is the engine exhaust pipe placed away\\nfrom the cabin and in good condition?\\n\\n— Are the engine covers and enclosures in\\nplace?\\n\\n10.2 Hand tools\\n\\nThere are many different types of hand\\ntool for different kinds of work, such as\\nshovels, axes, crowbars, chisels, screwdrivers,\\nhammers and wrenches. In many instances\\nthese tools are bought from an outside vendor\\nwithout paying any attention to their design or\\nquality.\\n\\nA good-quality hand tool should be\\ndesigned to fit the hand and the task. It will\\nearn money and reduce the possibility of\\naccidents. With the proper design of hand\\ntools, work posture can be improved and\\nstress can be reduced, resulting in an\\nimproved quality of work.\\n\\nAccidents with hand tools nearly always\\narise from some human failing — carelessness,\\nnot knowing the right tool for the job,\\n\\n[Page 69]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nignorance of safety precautions, or failure to\\nmaintain tools and to keep them properly. You\\nneed to be correctly instructed in how to use\\ntools and how to look after them.\\n\\n10.2.1 Selection, use and maintenance\\n\\nThere are basic considerations\\nselecting, using and maintaining hand tools:\\n\\nin\\n\\navoid static load at the shoulder or arm due\\nto the continuous holding of a tool at a\\nraised position or the gripping of a heavy\\ntool;\\n\\navoid awkward wrist angles while using\\ntools such as snips and pliers;\\n\\nreduce uncomfortable pressure on the palm\\nor joints of the hand, e.g. from pliers that\\nare too small;\\n\\nselect the correct weight, size and tool for\\nthe job;\\n\\nuse only tools of good-quality steel — tools\\nmade of inferior steel chip and may even\\nshatter when struck, tool heads mushroom,\\ntool jaws open out and cutting tools lose\\ntheir edge;\\n\\nhandles should have a smooth finish, should\\nbe easy to grasp and should have no sharp\\nedges or corners;\\n\\ntools should be firmly fixed and should be\\nregularly checked for splits and cracks;\\nwedges should be checked for tightness of\\nfit;\\n\\ntools should be kept free of grease and dirt,\\nand moving and adjustable parts should be\\nwell oiled;\\n\\ncutting edges should be kept sharp for\\naccurate working and to avoid the need for\\nunnecessary pressure;\\n\\nfor work on or near electrical apparatus\\nonly properly insulated tools should be\\nused;\\n\\ntools should be properly stored in boxes,\\nracks, holders or pocket belts and should\\nnot be left so that they can fall, roll or be\\ntripped over; cutting edges should be\\nsheathed;\\n\\n64\\n\\n— damaged tools should be immediately\\nrepaired or replaced.\\n\\nFigure 40 illustrates some worn hand\\ntools and those in good condition.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\nUse the right tool for the job.\\nCarry tools in tool holders and not in the\\n\\npockets of your clothing.\\n\\nReplace tools, before they wear out.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\ne Think of the hand tools commonly used in\\nconstruction — how would you classify the\\nrisks of each and minimize them?\\n\\n10.3. Power-driven machinery\\n\\n10.3.1 Hazards\\n\\nThe use of power-driven machinery on\\nconstruction sites involves many hazards.\\nCommon to many construction machines are\\nin-running nip points where one part rotates\\nagainst or close to another. Common\\nexamples are cog-wheels, chain and sprockets,\\nbelts and cylinder drums, and ratchet drives.\\nAll nip points should be assumed to be\\ndangerous and should be guarded to prevent\\napproach unless they are enclosed within the\\nmachine. Equally dangerous are rotating\\nshafts of whatever diameter and of whatever\\nspeed. A common cause of accident is\\nclothing becoming caught and wrapped\\naround the shaft. If the shaft is not\\ninaccessible within the machine frame, then it\\nmust be enclosed — a loose tube covering and\\nresting on the shaft is a cheap, convenient and\\neffective method.\\n\\n[Page 70]\\nWorking positions, tools and equipment\\n\\nFigure 40. Reject worn hand tools — use only those in good condition\\n\\n10.3.2 Safety precautions — safety devices do not prevent efficient use\\nWhen you use power-driven of the machine.\\n\\nconstruction tools and machinery, make it your If you are not satisfied on any of these\\n\\nregular practice to check whether: points, discuss them with your supervisor.\\n\\n— all protective devices and safety measures\\nsupplied with the machine are in position,\\nadjusted and working; Point to remember:\\n\\n— the machine appears to be safe to use even\\n\\n. : * A dangerous part of machinery requires\\nfor an inattentive worker;\\n\\na guard — a warning notice is not a\\n— safety devices are strong enough to substitute.\\n\\nwithstand wear from ordinary use; and\\n\\n65\\n\\n[Page 71]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n10.3.3 Circular saws\\n\\nAmong the most dangerous power-\\ndriven machines found on a construction site is\\nthe circular saw, mounted in a bench and used\\nfor ripping, deep-cutting or cross-cutting. The\\nmain causes of accidents are:\\n\\nhands coming into contact with the saw\\nblade either above or below the bench;\\n\\ntimber being thrown back by the revolving\\nblade;\\n\\nthe blade fracturing or disintegrating.\\n\\nThe top of the blade should be covered\\nby a form of hood which is designed to\\nprevent your hands touching the part of the\\nblade above the wood being cut. It should be\\nadjusted at the front or leading edge of the saw\\nso that it almost touches the surface of the\\nmaterial being cut, leaving no space for a hand\\nto pass through. Behind the blade, and set not\\nmore than 12 mm from it at bench level,\\nshould be fitted the device called the riving\\nknife. This prevents the cut closing on the\\nback of the blade causing the material to be\\nthrown back at the operator. These features are\\nshown in figure 41.\\n\\nParallel to the blade is the fence which\\nacts as a support and guide for the wood being\\nsawn and allows a true cut to be made. It\\nshould be locked securely in position before\\nthe cut is made.\\n\\nWhen hand-feeding material to the saw\\nblade, use a push-stick to keep your hands\\naway from the blade. Use the push-stick also\\nto remove the cut pieces from between the\\nblade and the fence and to remove offcuts\\nfrom the bench. When you are ripping long\\nlengths of material, they should be supported\\nas they come off the table.\\n\\nAlways keep the saw teeth sharp and\\nproperly set. A dull blade is much more likely\\nto break than a sharp one. Never use a blade\\nwhich is defective in any way.\\n\\n66\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\nNever leave the saw running after you\\nhave used it.\\n\\nAlways keep the push-stick at the table.\\n\\nNever start cleaning above or under the\\ntable until the blade has stopped.\\n\\nFigure 41. Circular saw showing top guard and\\nriving knife behind the saw blade. The\\ntop guard is adjusted low over the blade\\n\\n10.3.4 Compressed air tools\\n\\nIf air under compression is allowed to\\npenetrate the skin through a scratch, it can\\ncause painful swelling and may result in\\nserious damage if directed at the eyes, nose or\\nears. The most common cause of accidents\\nwith compressed air is its use to dust off\\nclothing at the end of a working shift. There\\nare also serious injuries caused by workers\\ndirecting compressed air at a colleague in\\nhorseplay.\\n\\n10.3.5 Cartridge-operated tools\\n\\nCartridge-operated tools, which are used\\nfor direct fixing to concrete, brick and steel,\\nshould be fitted with a guard which does not\\n\\n[Page 72]\\nWorking positions, tools and equipment\\n\\nallow the tool to be fired until the guard is\\naccurately positioned against the work.\\n\\nHead and eye, and hearing protection\\nshould always be worn (figure 42). The area\\naround the fixing should be cleared of workers\\nin case the material splinters or there is a\\nrejection or a ricochet of the fixing. Firing\\nagainst too soft or thin material may allow the\\nfixing to penetrate it and injure someone on\\nthe opposite side.\\n\\nThe recoil from firing the tool may cause\\nthe operator to lose balance — it should never\\nbe used from a ladder.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n¢ What are the risks associated with power-\\ndriven machinery? What would you do to\\nminimize these risks?\\n\\n¢ What safety devices would you expect to\\nfind on a circular saw, and what is their\\npurpose?\\n\\nFigure 42. Use of hearing and eye protection by the\\noperator of a cartridge gun, who is also\\nwearing a helmet\\n\\n10.4 Electrical equipment\\n\\nElectrical hazards are different from\\nother types of hazard found in construction\\nwork because the human senses provide no\\nadvance warning, whereas an approaching\\nvehicle may be heard, the prospect of a fall\\nmay be seen, or escaping gas may often be\\nsmelt.\\n\\nAbout one in every 30 electrical\\naccidents is fatal. The great majority of\\nelectrical accidents result in electric shock and\\nburns. Fire and explosion from sparks in\\nflammable atmospheres and radiation from\\nelectric arc welding or microwave heating are\\nalso possible causes of injury.\\n\\n10.4.1 Electric shock\\n\\nThe danger from electric shock is\\ndirectly related to the amount of current that\\npasses through the body and to the time that it\\ntakes to pass. At lower levels, the effect may\\nbe no more than an unpleasant tingle, though\\nperhaps sufficient to throw a worker off\\nbalance and cause a fall from a scaffold or\\nladder. Medium amounts cause increasing\\nmuscular tension, so that anything in the grasp\\ncan scarcely be released — a condition which\\ncan quickly become dangerous. Higher\\namounts can cause fibrillation of the heart\\n(irregular contractions of the muscles), which\\nis almost invariably lethal.\\n\\nThe passage of current can also cause\\nburning of the skin at the points of contact.\\nSevere burns can occur, too, from exposure to\\nan electric shock without actual bodily\\ncontact. Damp and wet conditions greatly\\nincrease the danger of electric shock.\\n\\nIt is the voltage that determines the\\ncurrent through the body. Since reduced\\nvoltage reduces the severity of electric shock,\\nit is common sense to use reduced voltage of\\n110 V wherever possible.\\n\\nThe main causes of electric shock are as\\nfollows:\\n\\n[Page 73]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nthe earth or ground wire becomes\\ndisconnected from its plug terminal and\\ntouches a live terminal so that the metal\\ncase becomes live;\\n\\nwrong connections are made to terminals on\\nthe plug or the equipment;\\n\\ndamaged or missing covers on fuse and\\nterminal boxes, or on socket outlets, expose\\nbare live conductors;\\n\\nflexible cables are damaged when they are\\ndragged over sharp surfaces or run over;\\n\\nmakeshift repairs are made to flexible\\ncables with insulating tape alone.\\n\\n10.4.2 Treatment for electric shock\\n\\nSwitch off the current, but if this is not\\npossible free the victim by using something\\nthat is non-conductive, long, clean and dry\\nsuch as a piece of wood or rubber, or a piece\\nof cloth such as a jacket. Stand on non-\\nconductive material such as a dry piece of\\nwood when carrying out this effort. Do not\\ntouch the victim before the current is turned\\noff.\\n\\nIf the victim is not breathing, start\\nartificial respiration, send for help and call a\\ndoctor. Continue artificial respiration until the\\ndoctor or ambulance arrives (figure 43).\\n\\n10.4.3 Existing supplies\\n\\nOn any site, power supplies may exist\\nbelow ground or overhead. As discussed in\\nsection 4.2, contact should be made with the\\nappropriate local or electricity authority at the\\nplanning stage of the job to determine the\\nroute and depth of any underground cables and\\nthe safety clearances advised, or if the finished\\njob necessitates their rerouting, for this to be\\ncarried out before work commences. Methods\\nof tracing and marking buried electric cables\\nare described in section 4.2.1.\\n\\n68\\n\\nFigure 43. Artificial respiration: Continue mouth-\\nto-mouth resuscitation until medical\\nhelp arrives\\n\\n10.4.4 Electrical installations\\n\\nElectrical installations should be dealt\\nwith and serviced only by competent\\nelectricians. All forms of electrically operated\\nequipment should be regularly checked and\\nmaintained in accordance with the\\nmanufacturers’ printed instructions. If\\nequipment appears faulty, do not tamper with\\nthe electrical part but send for an electrician.\\nWires and cables to fixed machines should be\\nattached to walls or ceilings, and should not\\ntrail over the ground where they are\\nparticularly susceptible to damage and to\\nmoisture. Do not tie power cables in knots\\nwhich can cause short circuits and shocks;\\nloop the cable instead. If you are operating a\\nfixed machine, an emergency stop device\\nshould be located within your reach.\\n\\nBefore using electrical equipment:\\n— inspect it for any defects;\\n\\n— check that the correct plug and fuse have\\nbeen fitted — never use makeshift\\nconnections to equipment, or to plugs, by\\nsticking bare wires into sockets or contacts;\\n\\ncheck that the insulation covering wires\\nand cables is not worn or broken;\\n\\n[Page 74]\\nWorking positions, tools and equipment\\n\\n— check that there is a good electrical\\nconnection at each joint of the earthing\\nsystem.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\n¢ If an accident is caused by contact with\\n\\nelectricity, switch off the current\\nimmediately.\\n\\nNever work on live wires or cables.\\n\\n10.4.5 Portable electrical tools and\\nequipment\\n\\nDouble-insulated and all insulated tools\\nare safer than ordinary tools because they\\nincorporate layers of protective insulation to\\nprevent external metal parts from becoming\\nlive.\\n\\nIf you use portable power-driven tools,\\nyou need to be properly trained in their\\nmaintenance and use.\\n\\nBefore operating a portable tool, check\\nit to ensure that:\\n\\n— there is no damage to the portable leads\\nand plugs — they are subject to heavy wear\\non construction sites (figure 44);\\n\\n— there is a correct fuse;\\n\\n— the tool is set at the right speed for the job;\\n\\n— leads and cables are kept out of the way of\\n\\nother workers and are not in contact with\\nwater.\\n\\nWhen you finish using the tool, make\\nsure that the moving part is fully stopped\\nbefore you put it down.\\n\\nFigure 44. Electrical installations — pay special attention to the condition of temporary or portable electrical\\n\\nequipment and its cables\\n\\n[Page 75]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ Never carry a portable tool by its cable.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n¢ Why is electricity particularly dangerous on\\nconstruction sites?\\n\\nWhat is the first precaution you should\\nconsider on a construction site, and why?\\n\\nBefore you begin to use a portable electric\\ntool, what should you check?\\n\\nWhat are the proper actions to take when a\\nworker has received an electric shock?\\n\\n10.5 Welding and cutting\\n\\nThe welding and cutting of metal, using\\n\\nboth the electric arc and oxyacetylene\\nmethods, is a process widely used in\\nconstruction.\\n\\n10.5.1 Electric arc welding\\n\\nDanger from welding is not only to the\\nwelder doing the job but also to those working\\nnearby. The risks include eye damage, skin\\ninjuries, burns and the inhalation of toxic\\ngases.\\n\\nThe following precautions are necessary:\\n\\nThe welder and anyone assisting should\\nwear suitable protective goggles or use a\\nface mask or shield to protect the eyes and\\nface from invisible ultraviolet and infrared\\nrays given off by the welding arc.\\n\\nGoggles must also be worn when carrying\\nout weld chipping to protect the eyes from\\nflying pieces of slag.\\n\\nThe welder should wear protective gloves\\nlong enough to protect wrists and forearms\\nagainst heat, sparks, molten metal and\\nradiation. Leather is a good insulator.\\n\\nThe welder should wear high-top boots to\\nprevent sparks from entering footwear.\\n\\n— The work area should be screened off with\\nsturdy opaque or translucent materials so\\nthat other workers cannot see the arc.\\n\\nThe workpiece should be well earthed, and\\nall equipment should be earthed and\\ninsulated.\\n\\nPrecautions should be taken against\\nstarting fires from sparks from the work\\narea: burning particles are capable of\\nstarting a fire 20 m away.\\n\\nGood practice in electric arc welding is\\nshown in figure 45.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\nIt is not enough to protect the welder —\\nthink of others working nearby who can\\nsee the arc.\\n\\nAlways switch off the current to the\\nelectrode holder when you put it down.\\nRemove matches and lighters from\\nyour pockets.\\n\\nFigure 45. Arc welding — workplace earthed,\\nwelder wearing personal protective\\n\\nequipment, workplace screened\\n\\n70\\n\\n[Page 76]\\nWorking positions, tools and equipment\\n\\n10.5.2 Gas welding\\n\\nAcetylene and oxygen are normally used\\nin gas welding. The cylinders should be stored\\nseparately since any mixture from gas leakages\\ncould be highly explosive. They should be\\nkept away from any source of heat and\\nshielded from direct sunlight. If not stored\\noutdoors, the store must be well ventilated.\\nThe cylinders in use should be retained upright\\nin a rack or trolley and not left free-standing\\n(figure 46). Flashback arresters should be\\nfitted to the cylinder regulators and non-return\\nvalves fitted in the hose connectors at the torch\\nend.\\n\\nFigure 46. Gas cylinders moved around the site in a\\ntrolley in which they are secured upright\\n\\nThe gas hoses should be in good\\ncondition and easily distinguished. They\\nshould be protected against heat, sharp objects\\nand dirt, especially oil and grease. These\\n\\n71\\n\\nsubstances can, even in small amounts, cause\\nan explosive ignition in the event of a leak in\\nthe oxygen hose. All joints, especially on the\\ncylinders, should be kept tight. If an acetylene\\ncylinder becomes accidentally heated, shut off\\nthe valves, raise the alarm, clear the area of\\npersonnel, apply water (if possible, totally\\nimmerse) and send for the fire brigade.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\n¢ Turn off all valves on completion of\\nwork.\\n\\n¢ Never use oxygen to blow dust from\\nclothing.\\n\\n10.5.3 Fumes\\n\\nWelding in a confined space, the use of\\nsome types of welding rod, or welding on\\ncertain painted metals may cause an\\naccumulation of toxic gases and fumes. If\\nlocal ventilation cannot be arranged, the\\nwelder should be provided with respiratory\\nprotection and a supply of fresh air. Welding\\ncarried out on metals covered with alloys of\\nlead, cadmium, mercury or zinc may lead to a\\nbuild-up of dangerous fumes requiring\\nexhaust ventilation. Fumes may also be\\nproduced from paint and plastic on the surface\\nbeing welded, and they should first be cleaned\\noff.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n¢ What sort of welding do you carry out on\\nsite?\\n¢ What safety measures are taken and why?\\n\\n10.6 Liquefied petroleum gases\\n\\nLiquefied petroleum gases (LPG) are\\ncommonly butane or propane, or a mixture of\\nboth. LPG, usually sold under trade names, is\\nwidely used on construction sites and is a\\nfrequent cause of accidents. A leakage of\\n\\n[Page 77]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nliquid from a cylinder immediately vaporizes\\nand, because it is heavier than air, flows along\\nthe ground and collects in drains, excavations\\nand other low-lying places. As it takes only 2\\nper cent of the vapour in air to form a\\nflammable mixture, if leakage occurs in a\\nconfined space there is a high risk of\\nexplosion. Whenever LPG is used indoors,\\nthere must be good ventilation.\\n\\n10.6.1 Storage\\n\\nLPG stores\\nfollowing standards:\\n\\nshould conform to the\\n\\nWhere LPG cylinders are stored on site, it\\nshould be in an open-air compound at\\nground level surrounded by a fence at least\\n2 m high; there should be sufficient shelter\\nto prevent cylinders being exposed to\\nextremes of temperature.\\n\\nThere should be no excavations, drains or\\nbasements nearby.\\n\\nThe compound floor should be paved or\\ncompacted level, and kept clear of\\nflammable material, weeds or rubbish.\\n\\nCylinders should be kept at least 1.5 m\\nfrom the compound fence and 3 m from the\\nsite boundary.\\n\\nCylinders should never be stored below\\nground level or closer than 3 m to cylinders\\ncontaining oxygen or materials which are\\ntoxic or corrosive, e.g. ammonia or\\nchlorine.\\n\\nThere should be notices stating “LPG —\\nHighly flammable” and prohibiting\\nsmoking and naked lights.\\n\\nCylinders, full or empty, should be stored\\nupright with the valve uppermost.\\n\\nThe valves of empty cylinders should be\\nkept closed, for if they are left open, air will\\ndiffuse into the cylinder and may form an\\nexplosive mixture.\\n\\nThere should be a dry powder fire\\nextinguisher at the store.\\n\\n72\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ A fire close to a cylinder may cause the\\n\\nLPG to boil and the cylinder to\\nexplode, with disastrous consequences.\\n\\n10.6.2 Handling\\n\\nWhen handling LPG cylinders, you\\nshould take account of the following points:\\n\\nA damaged or leaking valve can have\\nserious consequences.\\n\\nWhen cylinders are not in use, valves and\\nregulators should be protected by\\nappropriate caps.\\n\\nWhen moving cylinders use trolleys, skids\\nor mats and never lift by the valve\\nassemblies.\\n\\nBefore using a cylinder, ensure that all\\njoints are gas tight by using soapy water\\nand a brush.\\n\\nIf a leak is detected, move the cylinder as\\nsoon as possible to an open space and\\ninform your supervisor at once.\\nCylinders used for heating huts should be\\nkept outside the building.\\n\\nIf, when lighting a burner, the match or\\ntaper goes out before the burner ignites,\\nturn off the burner valve before lighting\\nanother match or taper.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ Whenever you are not using the\\ncylinder, turn off the valve.\\n\\n[Page 78]\\n11. The working environment\\n\\n11.1 Chemical substances\\n\\nA great many chemical substances are\\nused in construction — there is hardly a site\\nwithout them. They are found in adhesives,\\ncleaning agents for brickwork and stonework,\\ndecorative/protective treatments for timber and\\nmetals, floor treatments, fungicides, cements\\nand grouts, insulants, sealants, paints, solvents\\nand much else. Of particular importance are\\nsolvents, which are liquids commonly used in\\npaint strippers, lacquers, varnishes, surface\\ncoatings, thinners and _ similar cleaning\\nmaterials.\\n\\n11.1.1 Chemicals and their risks\\n\\nMany chemicals are hazardous, with a\\npotential for fire and explosion, or toxic, with\\nan inherent potential to cause poisoning. Toxic\\nsubstances cause both acute effects, such as\\ndizziness, vomiting and headaches, produced\\nin a short time by exposure to solvents, and\\nchronic effects resulting from exposure over a\\nlong period as in lung diseases such as\\nasbestosis and silicosis. Contact dermatitis\\nmay result from the contact between the skin\\n\\nand some chemicals. Acids and alkalis are\\ncorrosive and can damage both skin and eyes.\\n\\n11.1.2 Entry into the body\\n\\nA chemical can cause injury in various\\nways depending upon whether it is solid or\\nliquid, or in the form of airborne dust, vapour,\\nfumes or gas. The routes into your body\\n(figure 47) are by:\\n\\n— inhalation or breathing in. This is the most\\nimportant route of entry. Some toxic gases\\nand vapours cause irritation in the nose and\\nthroat and so give warning of their\\npresence; others do not, and penetrate to\\nthe lungs or blood stream. It is the smallest\\ndust particles, those not visible to the naked\\neye, which reach furthest into the lungs.\\nInhaled dust accumulates in the lungs,\\nproducing changes and causing an\\nincurable disease called “pneumoconiosis”.\\nBreathlessness and inability to work are the\\neventual consequence. Some dusts such as\\nquartz and asbestos destroy the lung tissue\\nand may lead to the development of\\ntuberculosis or cancer;\\n\\nFigure 47. Chemicals enter the body by inhalation, ingestion and absorption\\n\\nInhalation (breathing in)\\n\\n73\\n\\nIngestion (swallowing)\\n\\nAbsorption (skin contact)\\n\\n[Page 79]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\ningestion or swallowing. This is possible\\nwhen you handle chemicals such as lead-\\nbased paints and then eat or smoke without\\nfirst washing your hands, when toxic\\nvapours contaminate cups, plates or eating\\nutensils, or when you eat meals at the work\\nsite;\\n\\nabsorption through the skin. Some solvents\\ncan be absorbed through the skin into the\\nblood stream and may travel to internal\\norgans such as the brain and liver.\\n\\nContact dermatitis or eczema frequently\\nresults from the contact between the skin and\\nsome chemicals. Acids and alkalis are\\ncorrosive and can damage the skin and the\\neyes on contact. Unless large amounts of water\\nare used at once to rinse the substance off,\\nserious burns will be caused.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\nSome chemical hazards are easy to see\\nor smell. However, there are also\\n\\nchemicals that you cannot see or smell,\\nand which therefore present an extreme\\ndanger.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nWhat construction processes cause the most\\ndust?\\n\\nWhat precautions are taken?\\n\\nIn what construction processes are fumes\\nand vapours most likely to be encountered?\\n\\nWhat precautions have been taken on the\\nsite against the risk of inhalation of fumes\\nand vapours?\\n\\n11.1.3 Preventive measures\\n\\nAccidents and ill health from the use of\\nchemicals can be prevented if you know what\\nchemicals you are using and the risks they\\npose, and follow the established safe practice\\nin handling them. Generally, there is an order\\n\\n74\\n\\nof priority in the measures for dealing with\\nhazardous chemical substances:\\n\\n¢ Substitute the chemical with a harmless or\\nless hazardous one.\\n\\n* Enclose the process using the chemical, or\\nprovide other engineering controls such as\\nexhaust ventilation; this is often difficult in\\nconstruction processes.\\n\\n* Use personal protective equipment (PPE).\\n\\nIf the use of hazardous chemicals cannot\\nbe avoided, here are some basic safety\\nmeasures you can adopt to protect yourself\\nfrom danger:\\n\\nKeep containers of chemicals in a separate\\nand secure store.\\n\\nBecause two containers look the same, do\\nnot assume that they contain the same\\nmaterial.\\n\\nMake sure there is a label on the container\\n(figure 48) — if there is no label, then do\\nnot use the contents.\\n\\nRead the label and make sure you\\nunderstand what it says, then follow the\\ninstructions.\\n\\nIf the information is not sufficient to tell\\nyou how to handle the chemical safely, ask\\nyour supervisor for the chemical safety\\ndata sheet (figure 49) and do not use the\\nchemical until you have seen it; if you do\\nnot understand it, ask questions until you\\ndo.\\n\\nCheck that you are wearing the correct PPE\\nbefore you handle chemicals (the chemical\\nsafety data sheet should say whether you\\nneed gloves, eye protection, protective\\nclothing, rubber boots or respirators) and\\nthat the equipment is in good order.\\n\\nWhen opening containers, hold a rag over\\nthe cap or lid as some volatile liquids tend\\nto spurt up when this is released; transfer\\nthe contents of containers in the open air.\\n\\nAvoid breathing in any fumes from\\nchemicals. Provide good ventilation, or\\nwork in the open air. Leave the work area\\nimmediately if you feel dizzy or unwell.\\n\\n[Page 80]\\nThe working environment\\n\\n— If you are using large quantities of solvents,\\nwear impermeable clothing. Remove any\\nclothing wetted by solvents and leave it to\\ndry in a well-ventilated place.\\n\\n— Use the smallest quantity of chemicals that\\nis necessary for the particular job.\\n\\n— Eye protection should be worn when\\nchemicals are being moved or transferred\\non site.\\n\\n— When mixing or pouring chemicals using\\ntemporary containers, make sure they are\\nsuitable and correctly labelled. Never use\\nfood or drink containers.\\n\\n— Wash before you eat and do not eat or\\nsmoke at your workstation.\\n\\n— If the skin is splashed with a chemical, it\\nshould be rinsed immediately with plenty of\\nclean running water. Eyes should be\\n\\nFigure 48. Every chemical used on site should have\\na label and sufficient information to\\nensure its safe use\\n\\nAa\\n\\nflushed out thoroughly with water and\\nshould receive immediate medical\\n\\nattention.\\n\\nIf you are burned by a chemical, or feel\\nunwell after using a chemical, seek medical\\nattention without delay.\\n\\n— If there is a spillage of chemicals on the\\nground or floor, report the matter at once\\nso that the right action can be taken, such\\nas soaking it up with dry sand (figure 50).\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n* Never use solvents to remove paint or\\ngrease from your skin.\\n\\n75\\n\\nFigure 49.

Chemical spillage soaked up with dry\\nsand\\n\\n11.1.4 Highly flammable chemicals\\n\\nMany chemical substances used in\\nconstruction are highly flammable as well as\\ntoxic. The following precautions should be\\nfollowed when handling or using them:\\n\\n— Study the label and the instructions on the\\nchemical safety data sheet about safe\\nhandling and first-aid measures.\\n\\n— Remember that all flammable liquids give\\noff vapours which travel unseen into the air\\nand are easily ignited. Never smoke if there\\nare flammable chemicals in the area. Find\\nout what action to take in the case of fire.\\n\\n— Keep containers in the store until required\\nfor use, and return them there when you\\nhave finished with them. Store drums\\nupright.\\n\\n— Treat empty drums with as much care as\\nfull ones — they will still contain flammable\\nvapour.\\n\\n— Always transfer the contents of large\\ncontainers to small containers in the open\\nair.\\n\\n— Use funnels and spouts to prevent spillage.\\nSoak up any spillage with dry sand and\\nremove the contaminated sand to a safe\\nplace in the open air.\\n\\n— If you cannot avoid using highly\\nflammable liquids in an enclosed area,\\nmake sure there is an adequate supply of\\nfresh air. This can usually be achieved by\\nopening windows and doors to the full. If it\\nis necessary to use a fan, check that the fan\\nis electrically safe to use in a flammable\\natmosphere.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n* How would you recognize whether toxic or\\ndangerous chemicals are being used on\\nyour construction site?\\n\\n¢ Have you or anyone you know shown\\nsymptoms or suffered from using\\nchemicals? If so, what were they?\\n\\n¢ What steps do you think could have been\\ntaken, and were not taken, to prevent these\\nill-effects?\\n\\n¢ What flammable chemicals have you used\\non construction sites?\\n\\n11.2 Hazardous substances\\n\\n11.2.1 Cement\\n\\nCement mixes are a well-known cause\\nof skin disease. Both irritant and allergic\\ncontact dermatitis can result from proximity to\\nwet cement. Prolonged exposure to wet\\ncement (for example, if you kneel or stand in\\nit) may cause cement burns or ulceration of\\nthe skin. The following precautions should be\\ntaken:\\n\\n— Avoid breathing in cement dust, as well\\ndust created by the surface treatment of\\nhardened concrete which may contain a\\nhigh silica content, by wearing suitable\\nrespiratory protective equipment.\\n\\n— Protect the skin from contact by wearing\\nlong-sleeved clothing and full-length\\n\\n[Page 82]\\nThe working environment\\n\\ntrousers, with rubber boots and gloves\\nwhen required.\\n\\n— Protect the eyes; if any cement gets into the\\neyes, rinse them immediately with plenty of\\nwarm water.\\n\\n— Immediately wash off any dust or freshly\\nmixed cement that gets on to the skin.\\n\\n— Clean off your clothing and boots after\\nwork.\\n\\n11.2.2 Asbestos\\n\\nBreathing in asbestos dust can kill by\\ncausing irreversible lung damage and cancer.\\nThere is no known cure for asbestos-related\\ndiseases. The more asbestos dust breathed in,\\nthe greater the risk to health. There are control\\nlimits for the various types of asbestos. You\\nare likely to find asbestos in the following\\nsituations:\\n\\n(a) as asbestos insulation or coating used for:\\n(i) thermal insulation of boilers;\\n(ii) fire protection of structural steelwork;\\n(iii) thermal and acoustic insulation of\\nbuildings;\\n(b) as asbestos insulating board used in a\\nwide variety of places such as:\\n\\n(i) fire protection on doors, protected\\nexits, structural steelwork, etc.;\\n\\n(ii) cladding on walls, ceilings, etc.;\\n\\n(iii) internal walls and partitions;\\n\\n(iv) ceiling tiles in a suspended ceiling;\\n\\n(c) as asbestos cement, which is found as:\\n\\n(i) corrugated sheets (roofing and\\ncladding of buildings);\\n\\n(ii) flat sheeting for partitioning, cladding\\nand door facings;\\n\\n(iii) gutters and downpipes.\\n\\nBefore starting work\\n\\nIf it is not clear whether insulating\\nmaterial, boarding, and so on contain asbestos,\\nbulk sampling and laboratory analysis are\\nnecessary. This must be done by someone with\\n\\nsuitable training and experience.\\nAlternatively, you may assume that the\\nmaterial contains crocidolite (blue), amosite\\n(brown) or chrysotile (white) asbestos and\\ntake appropriate precautions.\\n\\nBefore starting any work with asbestos,\\nan adequate assessment must be made to work\\nout the precautions needed to control the\\nexposure to the substance. Work with asbestos\\nmay range from cleaning brake drums of\\nconstruction plant and vehicles to full-scale\\nasbestos removal.\\n\\nCarrying out work with asbestos\\n\\nIn many countries those who work with\\nasbestos to any extent, and in particular in\\nremoving and disposing of asbestos, require to\\nbe licensed or to hold a permit. In working\\nwith asbestos insulation board, workers will\\nprobably need to wear suitable protective\\nclothing. Only working methods that keep\\nasbestos dust levels as low as possible should\\nbe used (e.g. use hand tools and avoid\\nbreaking boards).\\n\\nAsbestos cement is less likely to\\ngenerate dust than many other asbestos\\nproducts, but the risk of asbestos dust release\\nis still present.\\n\\nWhen cutting asbestos cement, use hand\\ntools (or power tools fitted with exhaust\\nventilation equipment). Where it is not\\npossible to keep asbestos dust levels under\\ncontrol limits, respirators should be worn.\\nProtective clothing will probably be required\\nfor any significant work with asbestos cement.\\nIf you have to clean asbestos cement sheeting\\nencrusted with lichens or mosses, a system of\\nwet scraping/brushing is preferred.\\n\\nMethods’ of\\nasbestos dust include:\\n\\nlimiting exposure to\\n\\n— removing asbestos materials before starting\\nmajor demolition work. This prevents\\naccidental exposure to asbestos;\\n\\n— wet methods of removal (to suppress dust);\\n\\n[Page 83]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n— prompt removal and bagging of waste\\nasbestos, and disposal at an approved waste\\ndisposal site;\\n\\n— separating asbestos work areas from other\\ngeneral work areas.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ The dust you cannot see is more\\ndangerous than the dust you can see.\\n\\n11.2.3 Lead\\n\\nInorganic lead is found in many\\nconstruction products, e.g. electricity cables,\\npipes, gutters and old lead sheet roofs. Organic\\nlead is added to motor fuels, and storage tanks\\nwill be heavily contaminated.\\n\\nThere is a risk to health from inhaling\\ndust or fumes created by burning or cutting\\nmaterials containing lead, including painted\\nsurfaces, by welding, by grinding or cutting,\\nand by spray painting of leaded paints. Lead\\ncan be absorbed when swallowed, usually\\nwhen food is contaminated, and adequate\\nwashing facilities should be provided. Organic\\nlead compounds are readily absorbed through\\nthe skin.\\n\\nExcessive lead absorption causes\\nconstipation, abdominal pain, anaemia, weak\\nmuscles and kidney damage. It can also affect\\nthe brain, causing impaired intellect, strange\\nbehaviour, fits and coma. If you work with\\nlead in any form, you should take the\\nfollowing precautions:\\n\\n— Wash your hands regularly, and always\\nbefore eating; you are at higher risk if you\\nsmoke with lead on your hands.\\n\\nUse the protective clothing and respiratory\\nprotective equipment which should be\\nprovided whenever lead levels exceed\\nnational control limits.\\n\\nWear work clothing on the job and store\\nyour “street” clothing where it cannot be\\ncontaminated by your work clothing.\\n\\n78\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ Wash thoroughly and if possible\\nchange out of work clothing before you\\n\\nleave the site, otherwise you may be\\ntaking dangerous dust and dirt into your\\nhome.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n¢ What precautions have been taken at the\\nsite to prevent exposure to hazardous\\nsubstances?\\n\\n* Where asbestos is known or suspected to\\nbe present at the site, are adequate steps\\ntaken to prevent workers from being\\nexposed to the dust?\\n\\n* Have you noticed or heard any of your co-\\nworkers complain of symptoms which you\\nthink might be related to or caused by\\nexposure to hazardous substances?\\n\\n* Can you think of any other hazardous\\nsubstances used on construction sites?\\n\\n11.3. AIDS\\n\\nAIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency\\nSyndrome) is a disease caused by a virus that\\nattacks the body’s natural defence system,\\nallowing the development of illnesses and\\ninfections which would not otherwise have\\noccurred. The virus is transmitted by sexual\\nintercourse with an infected person or by\\ninjection or contamination with infected\\nblood.\\n\\nIt is not transmitted by normal social\\ncontacts such as touching an infected person,\\nsharing toilet and washroom facilities,\\ncrockery or cutlery.\\n\\n11.3.1 Precautions\\n\\nA danger of AIDS exists for workers\\nwho may be cut or wounded by infected\\n\\n[Page 84]\\nThe working environment\\n\\nneedles or razor blades found during\\nconstruction work, e.g. in disused buildings in\\nhigh drug abuse areas.\\n\\nIf you think you might cut yourself on\\nsharp items which may be infected, take care\\nby wearing heavy-duty gloves and overalls.\\nRemove old syringes, needles and razor blades\\nwith disposable tongs, put them in puncture-\\nproof bins and seal them. Your supervisor\\nshould make local arrangements to have the\\nbins incinerated.\\n\\nClear up blood or other spillages with a\\nsolution of strong disinfectant. If splashing\\nfrom infected fluids is likely (e.g. during sewer\\nrepair), protective clothing, including goggles,\\nshould be worn.\\n\\n11.3.2 First aid\\n\\nYour employer should provide sufficient\\ntraining and information about first-aid\\ntreatment.\\n\\nCuts or abrasions should be covered with\\nwaterproof dressings. In the case of injury,\\nthoroughly irrigate the wound and wash it with\\nsoap and water before dressing it. Always\\nwash your hands after treating a wound. In\\nmore serious situations involving open-wound\\ninjury, prompt attention is important, and\\nsensible first-aid procedures should be applied\\nbefore sending the person for more expert\\ntreatment.\\n\\nThe AIDS virus has been shown to be\\npresent in saliva and this has caused anxiety\\namong first-aiders. No cases of AIDS have\\nbeen reported anywhere by transmission of the\\ninfection from saliva. Nevertheless, a portable\\nmouth-to-mouth resuscitation device\\nincorporating a one-way valve can be used.\\n\\nAIDS generates fear because it is a new\\ndisease and many questions about it cannot yet\\nbe fully answered. It is not highly infective\\nwhen compared with other diseases such as\\nhepatitis B, which may be contracted in a\\nsimilar fashion. The modes of transmission are\\nknown and infection has not been associated\\n\\nwith any particular occupation, including the\\nconstruction industry.\\n\\n11.4 Noise and vibration\\n\\nConstruction sites are noisy places.\\nExcessive exposure to loud noise can cause\\npermanent damage to your hearing. Noise at\\nwork can cause stress, making it difficult to\\nsleep. Very high levels of noise caused, for\\nexample, by using cartridge tools can cause\\ninstantaneous hearing damage.\\n\\nThe levels of noise produced in\\noperations such as piling, tunnelling and\\ncleaning operations may be such _ that\\nunprotected persons will exceed their\\nmaximum recommended daily dose in a\\nmatter of seconds. Even a few minutes’\\nexposure every day to very noisy machines\\ncan be enough to start permanent hearing\\ndamage. Loud noise can cause a temporary\\npartial loss of hearing, with recovery time\\nvarying from 15 minutes to several days\\ndepending on the noise level. There may also\\nbe a “ringing” in the ears which should be\\nregarded as a warning — temporary loss may\\nbecome permanent with repeated exposure.\\nDeafness develops very gradually but cannot\\nbe cured once the damage has been done.\\n\\nNoise also makes it difficult to hear\\nsounds that you need to hear such as work\\nsignals and warning shouts.\\n\\n11.4.1 Noise control\\n\\nThere are several steps that can be taken\\non site to reduce noise:\\n\\n* Check that exhaust outlets are fitted with\\nsilencers or mufflers, and do not keep\\nmachinery running unnecessarily.\\n\\n* Keep compressor motor covers closed\\nwhen they are running (figure 51).\\n\\n* Check that concrete breaker mufflers and\\nsimilar devices are securely fitted (figure\\n51).\\n\\n* Check that machinery panels are secured\\nand do not rattle.\\n\\n[Page 85]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n¢ Ensure that sound-insulating screens are\\nprovided to reduce noise from stationary\\nplant, and that where practicable noisy\\nmachinery is sited behind earth mounds or\\nbrick stacks to isolate or screen it as far as\\npossible.\\n\\nFigure 51. Compressor noise control — keep covers\\nclosed, use muffler on pneumatic\\nhammer and wear hearing protectors\\n\\n11.4.2 Hearing protection\\n\\nIf you are working at or near a noisy\\nmachine:\\n\\n* ask if noise levels have been measured, and\\nwhat those measurements are;\\n\\n* remember that noise which is continuous at\\na level of 85-90 decibels (dB(A)) or more is\\ninjurious to hearing;\\n\\n* ask for appropriate earmuffs or ear plugs if\\nyou work with or near a noisy machine and\\nmake sure they fit properly and are\\ncomfortable (figure 51);\\n\\n* wear them all the time you are in a noisy\\npart of the site;\\n\\n* keep your hearing protection clean and in a\\nsafe place when you are not using it;\\n\\n80\\n\\n* insert ear plugs with clean hands;\\n\\n* look out for damage: if the earmuffs no\\nlonger fit properly or the seals have\\nbecome hard or damaged, ask for a\\nreplacement.\\n\\nIt is not true that ear protectors make it\\nmore difficult to understand speech or hear\\nwarming signals, as they reduce both\\nunwanted noise and alarm signals equally; the\\nsignal can actually be heard more easily.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n* Ifyou have to shout to make yourself\\n\\nheard by someone about | m away,\\nthere is a noise problem requiring\\naction.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n¢ List the sources of noise on site which\\naffect you.\\n\\n* Could noisy machines be separated from\\nother work?\\n\\n¢ What steps could be taken to reduce noise\\nfrom noisy machines that you use?\\n\\n¢ What problems can deafness cause?\\n\\n11.4.3 Vibration\\n\\nMany noisy machines or hand-operated\\ntools also transmit vibrations to the body —\\npneumatic rock drills or concrete breakers are\\ncommon examples. In this way they can injure\\nmuscles and joints, and affect blood\\ncirculation causing what is known as ‘‘white\\nfinger disease”. When using these tools you\\nshould wear gloves, which help to cushion the\\nvibrations.\\n\\n11.5 Lighting\\n\\nAll parts of the site need to be properly\\nlit by natural or artificial means whenever\\nwork is going on. Site lighting is always\\n\\n[Page 86]\\nThe working environment\\n\\nnecessary in those areas short of natural light\\nsuch as shafts and enclosed stairways.\\nArtificial lighting should be placed to avoid\\ndeep shadows — these may conceal hazards\\nwhich would be obvious in good light.\\nMounting of lights should be as high as\\npracticable to avoid glare, and lights should be\\nplaced so that workers do not have to work in\\ntheir own shadow.\\n\\nOnly robustly installed fittings which are\\nwell out of reach, such as floodlighting, should\\nbe at full mains voltage. Temporary electric\\nlighting should be installed by trained\\nelectricians using low-voltage equipment. You\\ncan assist in its safe use in the following ways:\\n\\nDo not interfere with the installation.\\n\\nReport any damaged insulation, on broken\\nbulbs, lampholders or fittings.\\n\\nMake sure that cables are fastened well off\\nthe ground and do not let cables or\\nconnections trail in wet conditions.\\n\\nDo not change bulbs yourself.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n* When moving from a very bright area\\n\\nto shaded area, give your eyes time to\\nadjust.\\n\\n11.6 Exposure to heat and cold\\n\\n11.6.1 Hot weather\\n\\nWorkers on construction sites are often\\nexposed to all weathers. In tropical countries\\nradiation from the sun, with high air\\ntemperatures and humidity, increases fatigue\\nfrom heavy work and causes heat stress which\\nmay lead to heat exhaustion and heatstroke,\\nthe latter a medical emergency, and to ill\\nhealth. The effects of heat combined with\\nphysical workload tend to accumulate.\\n\\nGood welfare facilities are essential to\\nhealth in hot climates, and the suitable\\n\\n81\\n\\narrangement of working time is important.\\nThere should be:\\n\\nsufficient work breaks: for moderately\\nheavy or heavy work 50 per cent or more\\nrest time is essential;\\n\\nrest areas away from workstations to cool\\noff;\\n\\nan adequate supply of clean, cool drinking-\\nwater: drink often and in small quantities;\\n\\nwashing facilities provided to keep work\\nclothes clean.\\n\\n11.6.2 How to keep cool\\nIt is helpful to learn how to keep the\\nbody cool:\\n\\n— Keep out of direct sunlight as much as\\npossible.\\n\\n— Avoid unnecessary quick movements.\\n\\nEnsure that there is air circulation in\\noperators’ cabins.\\n\\nAvoid wearing tight clothes or those which\\nprevent evaporation of perspiration such as\\nsome plastic materials.\\n\\nWear head protection.\\n\\nTake cool drinks regularly to replace\\nmoisture lost through perspiration.\\n\\nAdd salt to food or eat food that contains\\nnatural salt.\\n\\nFind a shady place for rest pauses.\\n\\nPoint to remember\\n\\n¢ Ifthe urine you pass 1s less than usual\\n\\nand strong and dark in colour, you are\\nnot drinking enough water to replace\\nloss through perspiration.\\n\\n11.6.3 Cold weather\\n\\nCold is not just uncomfortable — it may\\naffect health and judgement. Although not a\\nserious problem in tropical climates, it may\\nnevertheless be experienced at high altitudes\\nand in the early morning at sites which are\\nwell inland.\\n\\n[Page 87]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nSome of the hazards of cold weather are\\n\\nas follows: Point to remember:\\n\\n— There are more likely to be accidents if the\\ntemperature of the hands falls below 15°\\nCelsius: there is loss of concentration and\\ncoordination.\\n\\n¢ If someone appears to be suffering\\nfrom immersion foot or hypothermia,\\n\\nmove him or her into a warm place and\\n\\nallow slow recovery. Sudden warming\\n— Workers repeatedly using vibratory tools may increase the injury.\\n\\nsuch as rock drills may suffer “white\\nfinger” syndrome involving sensory loss as\\na consequence of cold.\\n\\n— Prolonged exposure to temperatures around\\nfreezing may cause frostbite or\\nhypothermia.\\n\\n— Wind can affect temperature. When the air\\ntemperature is 10° Celsius and the wind\\nspeed is 32 km per hour, the temperature,\\nso far as the body is concerned, falls to\\nfreezing. This is called the chill factor.\\n\\n— Even where the temperature is above\\nfreezing point, a condition called\\n“immersion foot” can occur in wet\\nconditions if the feet are not kept dry.\\n\\n11.6.4 How to keep warm\\n\\nThe following points should be\\nconsidered when working in cold conditions:\\n\\n— Choose clothing which allows moisture to\\nescape but does not allow wind and rain to\\npenetrate: waterproof clothing tends to\\nprevent evaporation of moisture.\\n\\n— Avoid bulky clothes, as they hamper\\nmovement — a number of layers of clothing\\nare preferred.\\n\\n— Hands and feet are particularly susceptible\\nto cold.\\n\\n— Use facilities for preparing hot meals and\\ndrinks, and for storing and drying clothing.\\n\\n82\\n\\n[Page 88]\\n12. Personal protective equipment (PPE)\\n\\n12.1 Why do you need PPE?\\n\\nThe working conditions in construction\\nare in most cases such that, despite all\\npreventive measures in project planning and\\nwork design, some _ personal protective\\nequipment (PPE), such as a helmet, hearing\\nand eye protection, boots and gloves, is needed\\nto protect workers. However, there are\\ndisadvantages in using PPE:\\n\\nWearing some forms of PPE may involve\\ndiscomfort to the user and slow down the\\nwork.\\n\\nExtra supervision is called for to see that\\nPPE is worn.\\n\\nPPE costs money.\\n\\nWherever possible, it is better to try to\\neliminate the hazard rather than providing PPE\\nto guard against it.\\n\\nSome PPE such as safety helmets and\\nfootwear should be used on all construction\\nsites. The need for other PPE will depend on\\nthe sort of work you do. Remember, too, that\\nproper work clothes will provide protection for\\nthe skin.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n* Itis safer and in most cases cheaper\\n\\nto eliminate hazards than to provide\\npersonal protective equipment.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n¢ What hazards are there on construction sites\\nwhich could be removed instead of using\\nPPE?\\n\\n* How could you make people wear PPE\\nwhen it is needed?\\n\\n¢ Why is PPE often uncomfortable?\\n\\n83\\n\\n12.2 Head protection\\n\\nFalling objects, overhead loads and\\nsharp projections are to be found everywhere\\non construction sites. A small tool or bolt\\nfalling from 10 or 20 m high can cause serious\\ninjuries or even death if it strikes an\\nunprotected head. Head injuries often occur\\nwhen moving and working in a bent position,\\nor when arising from such a position.\\n\\nSafety helmets protect the head\\neffectively against most of these hazards, and\\nyou should wear a helmet whenever you are\\non site and particularly when you are in an\\narea where overhead work is going on. These\\nareas, known as “hard-hat areas”, should be\\nclearly marked with safety signs at entrances\\nand other suitable places (figure 52). The\\nsame rule applies to managers, supervisors\\nand visitors. Only safety helmets which have\\nbeen tested to national or international\\nstandards should be used. A chin-strap on the\\nhelmet prevents it from failing off and should\\nbe used when appropriate.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n* Your safety helmet protects you only if\\nyou have it on.\\n\\n12.3 Foot protection\\n\\nFoot injuries fall into two broad types:\\nthose due to penetration of the sole by nails\\nwhich have not been knocked down or\\nremoved, and those due to crushing by falling\\nmaterials, which can be minimized by\\nwearing protective footwear. The type of\\nsafety shoes or boots to be used will depend\\non the nature of the work (e.g. the presence of\\nground water on construction sites), but all\\nsafety footwear should have an impenetrable\\nsole and uppers with a steel toe-cap.\\n\\n[Page 89]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nFigure 52. ‘“Hard-hat” areas — all or most parts of construction sites should be\\nmarked by signs as “hard-hat” areas\\n\\naude\\n\\nee\\n\\n84\\n\\n[Page 90]\\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE)\\n\\nThere are many types of safety footwear\\nnow available such as:\\n\\nlight, low-cut leather safety shoes for\\nclimbing jobs;\\n\\nnormal safety shoes or boots for heavy-duty\\nwork;\\n\\nrubber or plastic safety wellingtons or\\ngumboots which provide protection against\\ncorrosive substances, chemicals and water.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ There are designs of safety footwear\\nto suit all needs.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nShould the wearing of safety footwear and\\nsafety helmets be a rule for everyone on\\nsite?\\n\\n12.4 Hand and skin protection\\n\\nHands are extremely vulnerable to\\naccidental injury, and in construction more\\ninjuries are caused to hands and wrists than to\\nany other part of the body. Open wounds,\\nabrasions, fractures, dislocations, strains,\\namputations and burns occur. They are largely\\npreventable by better manual handling\\ntechniques and equipment, and by wearing\\nsuitable hand protection such as _ protective\\ngloves and gauntlets.\\n\\nAmong the common hazardous tasks\\nwhere hand protection should be provided are:\\n\\noperations involving contact with rough,\\nsharp or jagged surfaces;\\n\\ncontact with or splashes from hot, corrosive\\nor toxic substances such as bitumen and\\nresins;\\n\\nworking with vibratory machines such as\\npneumatic drills where some cushioning of\\nthe vibrations is desirable;\\n\\nelectrical work in humid and cold weather.\\n\\n85\\n\\nSkin trouble is common in_ the\\nconstruction industry. Contact dermatitis is the\\ncommonest type of skin disease. It feels itchy\\nand looks red, scaly and cracked, and can\\nbecome so bad that it affects your ability to\\ncontinue working. Wet cement is one of the\\nmain skin hazards, but other substances\\ninclude tar and pitch, which can cause skin\\ncancer after prolonged exposure, paint\\nthinners, acids for masonry cleaning and epoxy\\nresins. In addition to gloves, use barrier creams\\nand wear long-sleeved shirts, full-length\\ntrousers and rubber boots.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\nIf you notice any skin trouble, report it\\nto your supervisor at once.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nWhat common tasks in construction\\nproduce hand injuries?\\n\\nWhat could be done to avoid or minimize\\nthe dangers?\\n\\nAre there any risks attached to the wearing\\nof gloves?\\n\\n12.5 Eye protection\\n\\nIn industry many eye injuries occur as a\\nresult of flying material, dust or radiation\\nwhen the following jobs are being carried out:\\n\\n— breaking, cutting, drilling, dressing or\\nlaying of stone, concrete and brickwork\\n\\nwith hand or power tools;\\n\\nchipping and dressing painted or corroded\\nsurfaces;\\n\\ncutting off or cutting out cold rivets and\\nbolts;\\n\\ndry grinding of surfaces with power\\ngrinders;\\n\\nwelding and cutting of metals.\\n\\n[Page 91]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nIn some industrial processes there may\\nalso be a risk from the spillage, leakage or\\nsplashing of hot or corrosive liquids.\\n\\nSome of these hazards can be removed\\npermanently by proper machine guarding,\\nexhaust ventilation or work design. For many\\nhazards, for example, stone cutting or\\ndressing, personal eye protection (goggles,\\nsafety glasses or shields) is the only practical\\nsolution. Sometimes workers are aware of the\\ndanger they run and the consequences if their\\neyes are damaged, but do not wear eye\\nprotection. This is because the type chosen\\ninterferes with vision or is uncomfortable to\\nwear, or is not immediately at hand when\\nneeded (figure 53).\\n\\nFigure 53. Eye protection must be suitable,\\ncomfortable and available to encourage\\nworkers to wear it\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n* Ninety per cent of all eye injuries can be\\nprevented by suitable eye protection.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n¢ Which jobs on your site require eye\\nprotection?\\n\\n* How would you convince employers to\\nprovide eye protection and workers to wear\\nit?\\n\\n¢ What different types of eye protection are\\nneeded by workers doing the various tasks\\ncarried out during construction?\\n\\n12.6 Respiratory protection\\n\\nOn construction sites there are often\\ntasks where harmful dust, mist or gas may be\\npresent, such as:\\n\\n— rock crushing and handling;\\n— sandblasting;\\n\\n— dismantling buildings containing asbestos\\ninsulation;\\n\\n— welding or cutting materials with coatings\\ncontaining zinc, lead, nickel or cadmium;\\n\\n— paint spraying;\\n— blasting.\\n\\n12.6.1 Correct choice of respirator\\n\\nWhenever there is doubt about the\\npresence of toxic substances in the\\natmosphere, a respirator must be worn. The\\ncorrect type of respirator will depend upon the\\nhazard and the work conditions, and you need\\nto be trained in its use, cleaning and\\nmaintenance. Advice on suitable types of\\nrespirator and filter should be sought from\\nappropriate safety and health authorities.\\n\\nThe simplest masks are disposable paper\\ntypes. Remember that these are only effective\\nagainst nuisance dusts.\\n\\nThere are three types of half-face mask\\nwith filters (figure 54):\\n\\n— for protection against airborne particles, e.g.\\nstone dust, with a coarse filter fitted in the\\ncartridge (note, these filters have a specific\\nlifetime and should be changed as\\nnecessary);\\n\\n[Page 92]\\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE)\\n\\n— for protection against gases and fumes, e.g.\\nwhen using paints containing solvents, with\\na filter containing activated carbon;\\n\\na combination filter containing both a dust\\nand a gas filter. Cartridges must be replaced\\nregularly.\\n\\nA full-face mask can be fitted with the\\nsame types of filter, and it also protects the\\neyes and face.\\n\\nSelf-contained breathing apparatus with\\na full-face mask fed with air at positive\\npressure always gives the best protection, and\\nmust be used in confined spaces and whenever\\na sufficient supply of air or oxygen at the\\nworking place is in doubt. The air may be\\nsupplied from a compressor with a filter, or\\nair/oxygen bottles (figure 55). In a hot climate,\\nthe full-face type is the most comfortable mask\\nbecause it is looser fitting around the face and\\nthe air itself has a cooling effect. Users must\\nbe trained in the use of self-contained\\nbreathing apparatus and must keep to the\\nmanufacturers’ specifications.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\n¢ Respirators which are of the wrong type\\nand not properly fitting are positively\\ndangerous.\\n\\nFilters and canisters have a useful\\nlifetime. Follow the specification and\\ndo not he tempted to use the respirator\\nbeyond its stated lifetime.\\n\\n87\\n\\nFigure 54. Three types of half-face mask with filters\\n\\n[Page 93]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\nFigure 55. Self-contained breathing apparatus, with air supplied from either a compressor or air bottles\\n\\n12.7 Safety harness\\n\\nThe majority of fatal accidents in\\nconstruction are due to falls from heights.\\nWhere work cannot be done from a scaffold or\\nladder, or from a mobile access platform, the\\nwearing of a safety harness may be the only\\nway to prevent serious injury or death.\\n\\nCircumstances in which a safety harness\\nmay be worn were discussed in Chapter 7.\\nAnother common situation in which a safety\\nharness may _ be — used sometimes\\nsupplemented by the use of a safety net — is\\nmaintenance work on steel structures such as\\nbridges and pylons.\\n\\nThere are many types of safety belt and\\nsafety harness available. The manufacturer or\\nsupplier should be asked for advice on suitable\\ntypes for the intended purpose and for\\ninstructions on use and maintenance. A full\\n\\n88\\n\\nsafety harness should always be used in\\npreference to a safety belt.\\nA safety harness and its lanyard must:\\n\\n— limit your fall to a drop of not more than\\n2 m by means of an inertia device;\\n\\n— be strong enough to support your weight;\\n\\n— be attached to a strong structure through a\\nfirm anchorage point above the place at\\nwhich you are working.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ Make a habit of using the safety harness\\nprovided.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n¢ Which jobs on your construction site need a\\nsafety harness?\\n\\n¢ Why are they not used?\\n\\n[Page 94]\\n13. Welfare facilities\\n\\n13.1 Why welfare facilities?\\n\\nWork in the construction industry is\\narduous; it involves much manual or physical\\nactivity. It is also hazardous and dirty. Good\\nwelfare facilities not only improve workers’\\nwelfare but also enhance efficiency.\\n\\nWelfare facilities such as the provision\\nof drinking-water, washing, sanitary and\\nchanging accommodation, rest-rooms and\\nshelter, facilities for preparing and eating\\nmeals, temporary housing, assistance in\\ntransport from place of residence to the work\\n\\nsite and back, all help to reduce fatigue and\\nimprove workers’ health (figure 56). The\\nfacilities may be provided and maintained by\\none contractor for all workers or by individual\\ncontractors.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n* Welfare facilities improve morale and\\nconsequently improve efficiency.\\n\\nFigure 56. Suitable washing facilities and lavatories help protect the health of workers\\n\\n89\\n\\n[Page 95]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n13.2 Sanitary facilities\\n\\nNational laws usually prescribe the type,\\n\\nnumber and standard of sanitary facilities\\nwhich should be provided, but as a general\\nguide the following should be regarded as a\\npractical minimum:\\n\\na sufficient number of water flush-type\\nlavatories for men when this is practicable,\\nincluding sufficient urinal accommodation;\\nchemical lavatories may be used otherwise;\\na sufficient number of separate water flush-\\ntype lavatories for women when this is\\npracticable; again, chemical lavatories may\\nbe an alternative;\\n\\nthe accommodation should be designed and\\nconstructed so as to screen the occupants\\nfrom view and afford protection against the\\nweather;\\n\\nthe accommodation should be separate\\nfrom any messroom or rest-room;\\n\\na smooth and impermeable floor;\\n\\neffective natural and/or artificial lighting\\nand ventilation;\\n\\nat least 30 m from any well;\\n\\nconstructed for easy maintenance and\\ncleaned out at least daily.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n* Play your part in keeping the facilities\\nclean.\\n\\n13.3. Washing facilities\\n\\nWork in the construction industry is\\n\\noften dusty and dirty; it may also involve\\n\\nhandling chemicals\\n\\nand other dangerous\\n\\nsubstances, so that you need to wash your\\nhands and bodies regularly:\\n\\nto prevent chemicals contaminating food\\nand so being eaten during snacks or meals,\\nbeing absorbed through the skin or being\\ncarried home;\\n\\n90\\n\\n— toremove dirt and grime, which can also be\\ningested and cause sickness and disease;\\n\\n— asa basic hygiene measure.\\n\\nWhen construction work involves the\\nmaintenance of or alterations to existing\\nbuildings, it is often possible to use the\\nfacilities which form part of the building.\\nOtherwise, washing facilities should be\\nprovided to the following standards:\\n\\none wash-basin for every 15 workers with a\\nsufficient supply of water and an adequate\\nmeans of removing waste water;\\n\\nsoap, in the form of cake soap, or liquid or\\npowder soap in a special dispenser, to\\nfacilitate quick and proper washing, nail-\\nbrushes are needed where poisonous\\nsubstances are used;\\n\\nsuitable drying facilities such as paper\\ntowels, roller towels (or individual towels\\nfor each worker) or electric hand-dryers;\\n\\nfor facilities likely to be of longer duration,\\nmirrors and shelves at each washing point\\nwhich will help to keep the place tidy and\\nclean;\\n\\nwhere workers are exposed to skin\\ncontamination by chemical substances or by\\noil or grease, a sufficient number of\\nshowers, which should be disinfected daily;\\nfacilities should be covered to provide\\nweather protection, and effectively\\nventilated and lit.\\n\\nPoints to remember:\\n\\nAlways wash your hands before you eat\\n\\nmeals.\\n\\nDo not take home dirt from the site on\\nyou or your clothes.\\n\\n13.4 Facilities for supplying food\\nand drink, and eating meals\\n\\nFacilities for supplying food at\\nconstruction work sites can be particularly\\n\\n[Page 96]\\nWelfare facilities\\n\\nimportant when sites are located in remote\\nareas. Remoteness, together with inadequate\\ntemporary housing which lacks cooking\\nfacilities, may give rise to considerable\\nproblems for workers in the availability and\\nregularity of hygienically prepared and\\nnutritious meals. The problems of shiftworkers\\nmay be even greater.\\n\\nTo meet the need for proper meals, a\\nchoice of facilities should be made available:\\n\\nfacilities to boil water and heat food;\\n\\nfacilities (including provision of space,\\nshelter, water, heating and rubbish bins) for\\nvendors to sell hot and cold food and drink;\\n\\na canteen supplying cooked meals or\\nserving packed meals, snacks and\\nbeverages;\\n\\narrangements with a restaurant or canteen\\nnear the work site to supply packaged\\nmeals.\\n\\n13.4.1 The meal area\\n\\nThere should be accommodation with\\ntables and seats, protected from the weather,\\nwhere one can eat in comfort food brought\\nfrom home or bought from vendors. It should\\nbe situated away from workstations to\\nminimize contact with dirt, dust or dangerous\\nsubstances.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n* Construction work is physically\\n\\nexhausting, and you need hygienically\\nprepared and nutritious meals at regular\\ntimes.\\n\\n13.4.2 Drinking-water\\n\\nDrinking-water is essential for workers\\nin the construction industry, irrespective of the\\ntype of work they do. You lose several litres of\\nwater a day while at work and without\\nreplacement you gradually dehydrate, the loss\\nis greater in a hot environment.\\n\\n91\\n\\nArrangements for the supply of safe\\ndrinking-water may be:\\n\\nindividual closed water bottles or containers\\nwhen no other facilities are available, hung\\nclose to the workplace in a shaded place,\\nfree from dust and with plenty of air in\\ncirculation, cool water helps avoid heat\\nexhaustion. Containers should be cleaned\\nand disinfected at suitable intervals;\\n\\ndrinking-water containers made of\\nimpermeable materials with suitable covers,\\nkept in a cool, protected place. Unglazed\\npottery containers keep water cool, and they\\nshould be kept in dust-free places. The\\ncontainers should be cleaned regularly by a\\ndesignated person;\\n\\ndrinking-water fountains from a public\\nsupply with the water outlet shielded in a\\nmanner that prevents the lips of the drinker\\nfrom being placed against it. Drinking-\\nwater fountains are more hygienic than taps\\nand drinking vessels;\\n\\nwater taps from a public supply clearly\\nlabelled to distinguish between drinkable\\nand non-drinkable water. It is preferable to\\nuse disposable cups or to provide a separate\\ncup for each worker.\\n\\nDrinking-water should not be placed in\\nsanitary facilities, or in places where it can be\\ncontaminated by dust, chemicals or other\\nsubstances. Whatever the source of water\\nsupply for drinking, whether at the mess\\naccommodation or elsewhere on the site, it\\nshould be clearly marked as drinking-water in\\nwords or with a suitable sign.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\nDrink water only from sources clearly\\nmarked as drinking-water.\\n\\n[Page 97]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n13.5 Facilities for changing, storing\\nand drying clothes\\n\\nSecure facilities at the work site for\\nchanging from street clothes into work clothes,\\nand for airing and drying the latter, greatly\\nassist workers with their personal hygiene and\\ntidiness and relieve them of anxiety over the\\nsecurity of their possessions.\\n\\nChanging-rooms are particularly\\nimportant when workers change from street\\nclothes into protective clothing and when\\nworking clothes become wet or dirty. The\\nfacilities should include provision for drying\\nwet clothes, whether it be street or working\\nclothing. Separate changing facilities for men\\nand women workers should be provided, at\\nleast by adequate screening.\\n\\nThe provision of adequate seats, mirrors\\nand rubbish bins in the changing rooms or\\nclose to the lockers will assist workers in\\npaying attention to personal appearance and\\ncleanliness.\\n\\n13.6 Rest breaks\\n\\nConstruction workers begin work early.\\nThey start their day alert and productive but\\ntheir activity level decreases as the day passes.\\nFatigue develops gradually before it begins to\\nhave marked effects. If you rest before you\\nshow signs of being really tired, recovery is\\nmuch faster. Short breaks taken frequently are\\nmuch better than infrequent long breaks.\\nProductivity improves with frequent rest\\nbreaks.\\n\\n13.6.1 Frequency of rest breaks\\n\\nNational law may prescribe the length of\\na working day which includes a period or\\nperiods for rest breaks. At least one ten-minute\\nbreak in the morning and one in the afternoon,\\nin addition to a longer break for lunch, are\\nessential.\\n\\nWorkers are not just idle during rest\\nbreaks, but are recovering from fatigue and\\n\\n92\\n\\npreparing for continued productive work.\\nGetting away from a noisy or polluted\\nworkplace helps to relax and recover from\\nfatigue, and an area with seating and out of\\ndirect sunlight should be set aside for rest\\nbreaks.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\nBreaks which are short and taken often\\n\\nare better than long breaks taken\\ninfrequently.\\n\\n13.7. Child-care facilities\\n\\nWorking mothers employed at\\nconstruction sites often need help with the\\nspecial problems of caring for their children\\nwhile they are at work.\\n\\n13.7.1 Basic provisions\\n\\nA clean and_ well-ventilated room,\\npreferably with access to an enclosed space, is\\nthe main facility needed. A few items of\\nsimple furniture are necessary for the children\\nto sit or lie down, and some toys help. There\\nshould be provision for feeding the children\\nwith nutritious meals at regular times and, for\\nthis, there should also be access to cooking\\nfacilities or a canteen.\\n\\nIt is essential for someone to care for the\\nchildren while their mothers are at work,\\nprepare their meals and feed them regularly. It\\nmay be possible for mothers themselves to\\ntake turns to look after the children. Mothers,\\nespecially nursing mothers, should be able to\\nvisit their children during recognized breaks\\nfrom work.\\n\\n13.7.2 Watch the children’s movements\\n\\nEach year there are many tragic deaths of\\nchildren on construction sites. Children should\\nnever be allowed to wander into or play on\\nsites. There are excavations to fall into,\\nscaffolding to fall from, hazardous equipment,\\n\\n[Page 98]\\nWelfare facilities\\n\\nloose and dangerous building materials, and\\nchemicals lying about.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\n¢ Child-care facilities pay for themselves\\n\\nby relieving working mothers on site of\\nanxiety over the safety and welfare of\\ntheir children.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nIf you agree that good work-related\\nwelfare facilities improve workers’ health and\\nmorale and their efficiency, resulting in\\nimproved productivity and better work\\nrelations, what measures have you seen taken\\nto improve the following types of provision at\\nconstruction sites?\\n\\n— lavatories;\\n\\n— washing facilities;\\n\\n— eating facilities;\\n\\n— facilities for changing and storing clothes;\\n— drinking-water;\\n\\n— rest breaks;\\n\\n— child-care facilities.\\n\\n13.8 First aid\\nWhen there is an accident on site and\\nsomeone is hurt, you can help by:\\n\\n— calling for help from someone on site\\ntrained in first aid, or in cases of severe\\ninjury by calling an ambulance;\\n\\n— preventing others (including yourself) from\\nbeing injured from the same cause;\\n\\n— providing life-saving first aid, even if you\\nare not a trained first-aider;\\n\\n— reporting the accident at once to your\\nsupervisor.\\n\\n13.8.1 Emergency action\\n\\nThere are some situations where you\\ncannot wait for a trained first-aider. Doing\\n\\nsomething at once might save an injured\\nperson’s life. Here are some things you can do:\\n\\n— check breathing: turn an unconscious\\nperson from his or her back to the side to\\nprevent choking on the tongue; be cautious,\\nkeeping in mind the possibility of a neck\\ninjury;\\n\\n— provide artificial respiration if breathing has\\nstopped, using the mouth-to-mouth method;\\n\\n— stop heavy bleeding by direct pressure on\\nthe wound and by raising the injured limb\\n(do not try to use a tourniquet);\\n\\n— cool a burn with water for some ten\\nminutes, never with anything else —\\nextinguish burning clothing by rolling the\\nperson on the ground or wrapping them in a\\nblanket;\\n\\n— flush a burn from corrosives, or\\ncontamination of the eyes from any\\nchemical, with water for at least ten\\nminutes;\\n\\n— treat shock by lying the injured person on\\nhis or her side; loosen any tight clothing\\nand cover the person with a blanket to keep\\nhim or her warm;\\n\\n— immobilize a broken limb by bandaging it\\nto two sticks if no splint is available; even\\ntightly rolled newspaper will do.\\n\\nYou should not:\\n\\n— move an injured person except to remove\\nhim or her from danger;\\n\\n— remove any foreign object embedded in the\\nbody;\\n\\n— give the person anything to drink — you may\\nmoisten the lips and tongue if asked to;\\n\\n— move a broken limb.\\n\\nDeep cuts and abrasions carry the risk of\\ntetanus (lockjaw) and need to be treated by a\\ndoctor. Abrasions, even minor, carry a greater\\nrisk of infection than an open wound. After\\nstopping bleeding, clean cuts and abrasions\\nthoroughly with soap and water before\\ncovering them with a bandage. Make sure your\\nhands are clean. Always wash your hands with\\nsoap after you have finished.\\n\\n[Page 99]\\nSafety, health and welfare on construction sites\\n\\n13.8.2 Equipment and training\\n\\nConstruction sites are dangerous places,\\nand first-aid and rescue equipment should\\nalways be available. What is needed will\\ndepend on the size of the site and the numbers\\nemployed, but there should be at least a\\nstocked first-aid box and a stretcher and\\nblanket — the stretcher should be of a type\\nwhich can be raised and lowered to and from\\nupper floors. On large sites, and always where\\nmore than 200 people are employed, there\\nshould be a properly equipped first-aid room\\nor hut.\\n\\nOn any construction site of size, at least\\none person on every shift should have been\\ntrained in first aid to a nationally recognized\\nstandard.\\n\\nPoint to remember:\\n\\nSerious cuts, abrasions and burns must\\nbe treated as soon as possible by a\\n\\ndoctor or nurse. Limit first aid to a\\ndressing and bandage, if these are\\nnecessary.\\n\\n13.8.3 Moving an injured person\\n\\nIn principle, never move an injured\\nperson until a trained first-aider or a doctor\\ncan direct you. However, when someone is at\\nrisk of further injury and has to be removed to\\na safe place, lift him or her by using a stretcher\\nor a blanket. If you are alone and must rapidly\\nmove an injured person out of danger, then a\\ngood way is to drag him or her head first by\\nthe clothes.\\n\\n13.8.4 Investigation\\n\\nAfter an accident, leave the site\\nequipment undisturbed as far as it is safe to do\\nso, so that the cause of the accident can be\\nproperly investigated. Make sure also that any\\nobjects and equipment involved remain\\n\\n94\\n\\nuntouched. This is important if proper\\nmeasures are to be taken to prevent a repetition\\nof the accident.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nList the steps you would take if one of your\\nworkmates were injured.\\n\\nWhat facilities are there on your site to call\\nfor help and to treat injuries?\\n\\nHow would you give artificial respiration?\\n\\n13.9 Fire precautions\\n\\nFires on construction sites arise from the\\nmisuse of compressed gases and _ highly\\nflammable liquids, from the ignition of waste\\nmaterial, wood shavings and cellular plastic\\nmaterials, and from the failure to recognize\\nthat adhesives and some floor and wall\\ncoatings are highly flammable.\\n\\nEvery individual on site should be aware\\nof the fire risk, and should know the\\nprecautions to prevent a fire and the action to\\nbe taken if fire does break out.\\n\\nIf fire breaks out, get someone to call the\\nfire brigade. Do not continue trying to fight the\\nblaze yourself if large quantities of fumes are\\nbeing emitted in a closed space. Get out as fast\\nas possible.\\n\\nFires are sometimes caused by\\ncarelessness in drying wet clothes. Heaters for\\nthis purpose, gas, oil or electric, should be\\nmounted on and backed with non-flammable\\nmaterial, and enclosed in a stout wire mesh\\nwith effective air space to prevent clothing\\nbeing placed directly upon them.\\n\\nIf you have to use a blow lamp or torch,\\nor welding or burning equipment in the course\\nof your work, first make sure that there is no\\nfire risk to adjacent materials such as roof\\ntimbers. Many fires with disastrous\\nconsequences start from this source. Sparks\\ncan travel a long distance."}, {\'file\': \'workspace\\\\Form\\\\Streamform_Written_Safety_Program.pdf\', \'content\': \'[Page 1]\\nStreamform\\n\\nContractors, LLC\\n\\nSafety Program\\n\\n[Page 2]\\n1.
